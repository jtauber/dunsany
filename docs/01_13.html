  <h1>IN ZACCARATH</h1>
  <p>
    <q>Come,</q> said the King in sacred Zaccarath, <q>and let our prophets prophesy
    before us.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    A far-seen jewel of light was the holy palace, a wonder to the nomads on
    the plains.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was the King with all his underlords, and the lesser kings that did
    him vassalage, and there were all his queens with all their jewels upon
    them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Who shall tell of the splendour in which they sat; of the thousand lights
    and the answering emeralds; of the dangerous beauty of that hoard of
    queens, or the flash of their laden necks?
  </p>
  <p>
    There was a necklace there of rose-pink pearls beyond the art of the
    dreamer to imagine. Who shall tell of the amethyst chandeliers, where
    torches, soaked in rare Bhyrinian oils, burned and gave off a scent of
    blethany?
  </p>
  <p>
    (This herb marvellous, which, growing near the summit of Mount Zaumnos,
    scents all the Zaumnian range, and is smelt far out on the Kepuscran
    plains, and even, when the wind is from the mountains, in the streets of
    the city of Ognoth. At night it closes its petals and is heard to breathe,
    and its breath is a swift poison. This it does even by day if the snows
    are disturbed about it. No plant of this has ever been captured alive by a
    hunter.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough to say that when the dawn came up it appeared by contrast pallid
    and unlovely and stripped bare of all its glory, so that it hid itself
    with rolling clouds.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Come,</q> said the King, <q>let our prophets prophesy.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the heralds stepped through the ranks of the King’s silk-clad
    warriors who lay oiled and scented upon velvet cloaks, with a pleasant
    breeze among them caused by the fans of slaves; even their casting-spears
    were set with jewels; through their ranks the heralds went with mincing
    steps, and came to the prophets, clad in brown and black, and one of them
    they brought and set him before the King. And the King looked at him and
    said, <q>Prophesy unto us.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And the prophet lifted his head, so that his beard came clear from his
    brown cloak, and the fans of the slaves that fanned the warriors wafted
    the tip of it a little awry. And he spake to the King, and spake thus:
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Woe unto thee, King, and woe unto Zaccarath. Woe unto thee, and woe unto
    thy women, for your fall shall be sore and soon. Already in Heaven the
    gods shun thy god: they know his doom and what is written of him: he sees
    oblivion before him like a mist. Thou hast aroused the hate of the
    mountaineers. They hate thee all along the crags of Droom. The evilness of
    thy days shall bring down the Zeedians on thee as the suns of springtide
    bring the avalanche down. They shall do unto Zaccarath as the avalanche
    doth unto the hamlets of the valley.</q> When the queens chattered or
    tittered among themselves, he merely raised his voice and still spake on:
    <q>Woe to these walls and the carven things upon them. The hunter shall know
    the camping-places of the nomads by the marks of the camp-fires on the
    plain, but he shall not know the place of Zaccarath.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    A few of the recumbent warriors turned their heads to glance at the
    prophet when he ceased. Far overhead the echoes of his voice hummed on
    awhile among the cedarn rafters.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Is he not splendid?</q> said the King. And many of that assembly beat with
    their palms upon the polished floor in token of applause. Then the prophet
    was conducted back to his place at the far end of that mighty hall, and
    for a while musicians played on marvellous curved horns, while drums
    throbbed behind them hidden in a recess. The musicians were sitting
    crosslegged on the floor, all blowing their huge horns in the brilliant
    torchlight, but as the drums throbbed louder in the dark they arose and
    moved slowly nearer to the King. Louder and louder drummed the drums in
    the dark, and nearer and nearer moved the men with the horns, so that
    their music should not be drowned by the drums before it reached the King.
  </p>
  <p>
    A marvellous scene it was when the tempestuous horns were halted before
    the King, and the drums in the dark were like the thunder of God; and the
    queens were nodding their heads in time to the music, with their diadems
    flashing like heavens of falling stars; and the warriors lifted their
    heads and shook, as they lifted them, the plumes of those golden birds
    which hunters wait for by the Liddian lakes, in a whole lifetime killing
    scarcely six, to make the crests that the warriors wore when they feasted
    in Zaccarath. Then the King shouted and the warriors sang—almost they
    remembered then old battle-chants. And, as they sang, the sound of the
    drums dwindled, and the musicians walked away backwards, and the drumming
    became fainter and fainter as they walked, and altogether ceased, and they
    blew no more on their fantastic horns. Then the assemblage beat on the
    floor with their palms. And afterwards the queens besought the King to
    send for another prophet. And the heralds brought a singer, and placed him
    before the King; and the singer was a young man with a harp. And he swept
    the strings of it, and when there was silence he sang of the iniquity of
    the King. And he foretold the onrush of the Zeedians, and the fall and the
    forgetting of Zaccarath, and the coming again of the desert to its own,
    and the playing about of little lion cubs where the courts of the palace
    had stood.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Of what is he singing?</q> said a queen to a queen.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>He is singing of everlasting Zaccarath.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    As the singer ceased the assemblage beat listlessly on the floor, and the
    King nodded to him, and he departed.
  </p>
  <p>
    When all the prophets had prophesied to them and all the singers sung,
    that royal company arose and went to other chambers, leaving the hall of
    festival to the pale and lonely dawn. And alone were left the lion-headed
    gods that were carven out of the walls; silent they stood, and their rocky
    arms were folded. And shadows over their faces moved like curious thoughts
    as the torches flickered and the dull dawn crossed the fields. And the
    colours began to change in the chandeliers.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the last lutanist fell asleep the birds began to sing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Never was greater splendour or a more famous hall. When the queens went
    away through the curtained door with all their diadems, it was as though
    the stars should arise in their stations and troop together to the West at
    sunrise.
  </p>
  <p>
    And only the other day I found a stone that had undoubtedly been a part of
    Zaccarath, it was three inches long and an inch broad; I saw the edge of
    it uncovered by the sand. I believe that only three other pieces have been
    found like it.
