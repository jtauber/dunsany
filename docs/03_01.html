  <h1>A Tale of London</h1>
  <p>
    <q>Come,</q> said the Sultan to his hasheesh-eater in the very furthest
    lands that know Bagdad, <q>dream to me now of London.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And the hasheesh-eater made a low obeisance and seated himself
    cross-legged upon a purple cushion broidered with golden poppies, on
    the floor, beside an ivory bowl where the hasheesh was, and having
    eaten liberally of the hasheesh blinked seven times and spoke thus:
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">O Friend of God, know then that London is the desiderate town even of
    all Earth’s cities. Its houses are of ebony and cedar which they roof
    with thin copper plates that the hand of Time turns green. They have
    golden balconies in which amethysts are where they sit and watch the
    sunset. Musicians in the gloaming steal softly along the ways; unheard
    their feet fall on the white sea-sand with which those ways are
    strewn, and in the darkness suddenly they play on dulcimers and
    instruments with strings. Then are there murmurs in the balconies
    praising their skill, then are there bracelets cast down to them for
    reward and golden necklaces and even pearls.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">Indeed but the city is fair; there is by the sandy ways a paving all
    alabaster, and the lanterns along it are of chrysoprase, all night
    long they shine green, but of amethyst are the lanterns of the
    balconies.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">As the musicians go along the ways dancers gather about them and
    dance upon the alabaster pavings, for joy and not for hire. Sometimes
    a window opens far up in an ebony palace and a wreath is cast down to
    a dancer or orchids showered upon them.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Indeed of many cities have I dreamt but of none fairer, through many
    marble metropolitan gates hasheesh has led me, but London is its
    secret, the last gate of all; the ivory bowl has nothing more to show.
    And indeed even now the imps that crawl behind me and that will not
    let me be are plucking me by the elbow and bidding my spirit return,
    for well they know that I have seen too much. <q>No, not London,</q> they
    say; and therefore I will speak of some other city, a city of some
    less mysterious land, and anger not the imps with forbidden things. I
    will speak of Persepolis or famous Thebes.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    A shade of annoyance crossed the Sultan’s face, a look of thunder that
    you had scarcely seen, but in those lands they watched his visage
    well, and though his spirit was wandering far away and his eyes were
    bleared with hasheesh yet that storyteller there and then perceived
    the look that was death, and sent his spirit back at once to London as
    a man runs into his house when the thunder comes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>And therefore,</q> he continued, <q>in the desiderate city, in London, all
    their camels are pure white. Remarkable is the swiftness of their
    horses, that draw their chariots that are of ivory along those sandy
    ways and that are of surpassing lightness, they have little bells of
    silver upon their horses’ heads. O Friend of God, if you perceived
    their merchants! The glory of their dresses in the noonday! They are
    no less gorgeous than those butterflies that float about their
    streets. They have overcloaks of green and vestments of azure, huge
    purple flowers blaze on their overcloaks, the work of cunning needles,
    the centres of the flowers are of gold and the petals of purple. All
    their hats are black—</q> (<q>No, no,</q> said the Sultan)—<q class="noclose">but irises are
    set about the brims, and green plumes float above the crowns of them.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>They have a river that is named the Thames, on it their ships go up
    with violet sails bringing incense for the braziers that perfume the
    streets, new songs exchanged for gold with alien tribes, raw silver
    for the statues of their heroes, gold to make balconies where the
    women sit, great sapphires to reward their poets with, the secrets of
    old cities and strange lands, the earning of the dwellers in far
    isles, emeralds, diamonds, and the hoards of the sea. And whenever a
    ship comes into port and furls its violet sails and the news spreads
    through London that she has come, then all the merchants go down to
    the river to barter, and all day long the chariots whirl through the
    streets, and the sound of their going is a mighty roar all day until
    evening, their roar is even like—</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Not so,</q> said the Sultan.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Truth is not hidden from the Friend of God,</q> replied the
    hasheesh-eater, <q>I have erred being drunken with the hasheesh, for in
    the desiderate city, even in London, so thick upon the ways is the
    white sea-sand with which the city glimmers that no sound comes from
    the path of the charioteers, but they go softly like a light
    sea-wind.</q> (<q>It is well,</q> said the Sultan.) <q class="noclose">They go softly down to
    the port where the vessels are, and the merchandise in from the sea,
    amongst the wonders that the sailors show, on land by the high ships,
    and softly they go though swiftly at evening back to their homes.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">O would that the Munificent, the Illustrious, the Friend of God, had
    even seen these things, had seen the jewellers with their empty
    baskets, bargaining there by the ships, when the barrels of emeralds
    came up from the hold. Or would that he had seen the fountains there
    in silver basins in the midst of the ways. I have seen small spires
    upon their ebony houses and the spires were all of gold, birds
    strutted there upon the copper roofs from golden spire to spire that
    have no equal for splendour in all the woods of the world. And over
    London the desiderate city the sky is so deep a blue that by this
    alone the traveller may know where he has come, and may end his
    fortunate journey. Nor yet for any colour of the sky is there too
    great heat in London, for along its ways a wind blows always from the
    South gently and cools the city.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Such, O Friend of God, is indeed the city of London, lying very far
    off on the yonder side of Bagdad, without a peer for beauty or
    excellence of its ways among the towns of the earth or cities of song;
    and even so, as I have told, its fortunate citizens dwell, with their
    hearts ever devising beautiful things and from the beauty of their own
    fair work that is more abundant around them every year, receiving new
    inspirations to work things more beautiful yet.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>And is their government good?</q> the Sultan said.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>It is most good,</q> said the hasheesh-eater, and fell backwards upon
    the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    He lay thus and was silent. And when the Sultan perceived he would
    speak no more that night he smiled and lightly applauded.
  </p>
  <p>
    And there was envy in that palace, in lands beyond Bagdad, of all that
    dwell in London.
