  <h1>HOW ONE CAME, AS WAS FORETOLD, TO THE CITY OF NEVER</h1>
  <p>
    The child that played about the terraces and gardens in sight of the
    Surrey hills never knew that it was he that should come to the
    Ultimate City, never knew that he should see the Under Pits, the
    barbicans and the holy minarets of the mightiest city known. I think
    of him now as a child with a little red watering-can going about the
    gardens on a summer’s day that lit the warm south country, his
    imagination delighted with all tales of quite little adventures, and
    all the while there was reserved for him that feat at which men
    wonder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking in other directions, away from the Surrey hills, through all
    his infancy he saw that precipice that, wall above wall and mountain
    above mountain, stands at the edge of the World, and in perpetual
    twilight alone with the Moon and the Sun holds up the inconceivable
    City of Never. To tread its streets he was destined; prophecy knew it.
    He had the magic halter, and a worn old rope it was; an old wayfaring
    woman had given it to him: it had the power to hold any animal whose
    race had never known captivity, such as the unicorn, the hippogriff
    Pegasus, dragons and wyverns; but with a lion, giraffe, camel or
    horse it was useless.
  </p>
  <p>
    How often we have seen that City of Never, that marvel of the Nations!
    Not when it is night in the World, and we can see no further than the
    stars; not when the sun is shining where we dwell, dazzling our eyes;
    but when the sun has set on some stormy days, all at once repentant at
    evening, and those glittering cliffs reveal themselves which we almost
    take to be clouds, and it is twilight with us as it is for ever with
    them, then on their gleaming summits we see those golden domes that
    overpeer the edges of the World and seem to dance with dignity and
    calm in that gentle light of evening that is Wonder’s native haunt.
    Then does the City of Never, unvisited and afar, look long at her
    sister the World.
  </p>
  <p>
    It had been prophecied that he should come there. They knew it when
    the pebbles were being made and before the isles of coral were given
    unto the sea. And thus the prophecy came unto fulfilment and passed
    into history, and so at length to Oblivion, out of which I drag it as
    it goes floating by, into which I shall one day tumble. The
    hippogriffs dance before dawn in the upper air; long before sunrise
    flashes upon our lawns they go to glitter in light that has not yet
    come to the World, and as the dawn works up from the ragged hills and
    the stars feel it they go slanting earthwards, till sunlight touches
    the tops of the tallest trees, and the hippogriffs alight with a
    rattle of quills and fold their wings and gallop and gambol away till
    they come to some prosperous, wealthy, detestable town, and they leap
    at once from the fields and soar away from the sight of it, pursued by
    the horrible smoke of it until they come again to the pure blue air.
  </p>
  <p>
    He whom prophecy had named from of old to come to the City of Never,
    went down one midnight with his magic halter to a lake-side where the
    hippogriffs alighted at dawn, for the turf was soft there and they
    could gallop far before they came to a town, and there he waited
    hidden near their hoofmarks. And the stars paled a little and grew
    indistinct; but there was no other sign as yet of the dawn, when there
    appeared far up in the deeps of the night two little saffron specks,
    then four and five: it was the hippogriffs dancing and twirling around
    in the sun. Another flock joined them, there were twelve of them now;
    they danced there, flashing their colours back to the sun, they
    descended in wide curves slowly; trees down on earth revealed against
    the sky, jet-black each delicate twig; a star disappeared from a
    cluster, now another; and dawn came on like music, like a new song.
    Ducks shot by to the lake from still dark fields of corn, far voices
    uttered, a colour grew upon water, and still the hippogriffs gloried
    in the light, revelling up in the sky; but when pigeons stirred on the
    branches and the first small bird was abroad, and little coots from
    the rushes ventured to peer about, then there came down on a sudden
    with a thunder of feathers the hippogriffs, and, as they landed from
    their celestial heights all bathed with the day’s first sunlight, the
    man whose destiny it was as from of old to come to the City of Never,
    sprang up and caught the last with the magic halter. It plunged, but
    could not escape it, for the hippogriffs are of the uncaptured races,
    and magic has power over the magical, so the man mounted it, and it
    soared again for the heights whence it had come, as a wounded beast
    goes home. But when they came to the heights that venturous rider saw
    huge and fair to the left of him the destined City of Never, and he
    beheld the towers of Lel and Lek, Neerib and Akathooma, and the cliffs
    of Toldenarba a-glistening in the twilight like an alabaster statue of
    the Evening. Towards them he wrenched the halter, towards Toldenarba
    and the Under Pits; the wings of the hippogriff roared as the halter
    turned him. Of the Under Pits who shall tell? Their mystery is secret.
    It is held by some that they are the sources of night, and that
    darkness pours from them at evening upon the world; while others hint
    that knowledge of these might undo our civilization.
  </p>
  <p>
    There watched him ceaselessly from the Under Pits those eyes whose duty
    it is; from further within and deeper, the bats that dwell there arose
    when they saw the surprise in the eyes; the sentinels on the bulwarks
    beheld that stream of bats and lifted up their spears as it were for
    war. Nevertheless when they perceived that that war for which they
    watched was not now come upon them, they lowered their spears and
    suffered him to enter, and he passed whirring through the earthward
    gateway. Even so he came, as foretold, to the City of Never perched upon
    Toldenarba, and saw late twilight on those pinnacles that know no other
    light. All the domes were of copper, but the spires on their summits
    were gold. Little steps of onyx ran all this way and that. With cobbled
    agates were its streets a glory. Through small square panes of
    rose-quartz the citizens looked from their houses. To them as they
    looked abroad the World far-off seemed happy. Clad though that city was
    in one robe always, in twilight, yet was its beauty worthy of even so
    lovely a wonder: city and twilight were both peerless but for each
    other. Built of a stone unknown in the world we tread were its bastions,
    quarried we know not where, but called by the gnomes <em>abyx</em>, it so
    flashed back to the twilight its glories, colour for colour, that none
    can say of them where their boundary is, and which the eternal twilight,
    and which the City of Never; they are the twin-born children, the
    fairest daughters of Wonder. Time had been there, but not to work
    destruction; he had turned to a fair, pale green the domes that were
    made of copper, the rest he had left untouched, even he, the destroyer
    of cities, by what bribe I know not averted. Nevertheless they often
    wept in Never for change and passing away, mourning catastrophes in
    other worlds, and they built temples sometimes to ruined stars that had
    fallen flaming down from the Milky Way, giving them worship still when
    by us long since forgotten. Other temples they have—who knows to what
    divinities?
  </p>
  <p>
    And he that was destined alone of men to come to the City of Never was
    well content to behold it as he trotted down its agate street, with
    the wings of his hippogriff furled, seeing at either side of him
    marvel on marvel of which even China is ignorant. Then as he neared
    the city’s further rampart by which no inhabitant stirred, and looked
    in a direction to which no houses faced with any rose-pink windows, he
    suddenly saw far-off, dwarfing the mountains, an even greater city.
    Whether that city was built upon the twilight or whether it rose from
    the coasts of some other world he did not know. He saw it dominate the
    City of Never, and strove to reach it; but at this unmeasured home of
    unknown colossi the hippogriff shied frantically, and neither the
    magic halter nor anything that he did could make the monster face it.
    At last, from the City of Never’s lonely outskirts where no
    inhabitants walked, the rider turned slowly earthward. He knew now why
    all the windows faced this way—the denizens of the twilight gazed at
    the world and not at a greater than them. Then from the last step of
    the earthward stairway, like lead past the Under Pits and down the
    glittering face of Toldenarba, down from the overshadowed glories of
    the gold-tipped City of Never and out of perpetual twilight, swooped
    the man on his winged monster: the wind that slept at the time leaped
    up like a dog at their onrush, it uttered a cry and ran past them.
    Down on the World it was morning; night was roaming away with his
    cloak trailed behind him, white mists turned over and over as he went,
    the orb was grey but it glittered, lights blinked surprisingly in
    early windows, forth over wet, dim fields went cows from their houses:
    even in this hour touched the fields again the feet of the hippogriff.
    And the moment that the man dismounted and took off his magic halter
    the hippogriff flew slanting away with a whirr, going back to some
    airy dancing-place of his people.
  </p>
  <p>
    And he that surmounted glittering Toldenarba and came alone of men to
    the City of Never has his name and his fame among nations; but he and
    the people of that twilit city well know two things unguessed by other
    men, they that there is another city fairer than theirs, and he—a
    deed unaccomplished.
