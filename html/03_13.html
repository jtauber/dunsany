  <h1>A Tale of the Equator</h1>
  <p>
    He who is Sultan so remote to the East that his dominions were deemed
    fabulous in Babylon, whose name is a by-word for distance today in the
    streets of Bagdad, whose capital bearded travellers invoke by name in
    the gate at evening to gather hearers to their tales when the smoke of
    tobacco arises, dice rattle and taverns shine; even he in that very
    city made mandate, and said: <q>Let there be brought hither all my
    learned men that they may come before me and rejoice my heart with
    learning.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Men ran and clarions sounded, and it was so that there came before the
    Sultan all of his learned men. And many were found wanting. But of
    those that were able to say acceptable things, ever after to be named
    The Fortunate, one said that to the South of the Earth lay a Land—
    said Land was crowned with lotus—where it was summer in our winter
    days and where it was winter in summer.
  </p>
  <p>
    And when the Sultan of those most distant lands knew that the Creator
    of All had contrived a device so vastly to his delight his merriment
    knew no bounds. On a sudden he spake and said, and this was the gist
    of his saying, that upon that line of boundary or limit that divided
    the North from the South a palace be made, where in the Northern
    courts should summer be, while in the South was winter; so should he
    move from court to court according to his mood, and dally with the
    summer in the morning and spend the noon with snow. So the Sultan’s
    poets were sent for and bade to tell of that city, foreseeing its
    splendour far away to the South and in the future of time; and some
    were found fortunate. And of those that were found fortunate and were
    crowned with flowers none earned more easily the Sultan’s smile (on
    which long days depended) than he that foreseeing the city spake of it
    thus:
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">In seven years and seven days, O Prop of Heaven, shall thy builders
    build it, thy palace that is neither North nor South, where neither
    summer nor winter is sole lord of the hours. White I see it, very
    vast, as a city, very fair, as a woman, Earth’s wonder, with many
    windows, with thy princesses peering out at twilight; yea, I behold
    the bliss of the gold balconies, and hear a rustling down long
    galleries and the doves’ coo upon its sculptured eaves. O Prop of
    Heaven, would that so fair a city were built by thine ancient sires,
    the children of the sun, that so might all men see it even today, and
    not the poets only, whose vision sees it so far away to the South and
    in the future of time.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">O King of the Years, it shall stand midmost on that line that
    divideth equally the North from the South and that parteth the seasons
    asunder as with a screen. On the Northern side when summer is in the
    North thy silken guards shall pace by dazzling walls while thy
    spearsmen clad in furs go round the South. But at the hour of noon in
    the midmost day of the year thy chamberlain shall go down from his
    high place and into the midmost court, and men with trumpets shall go
    down behind him, and he shall utter a great cry at noon, and the men
    with trumpets shall cause their trumpets to blare, and the spearsmen
    clad in furs shall march to the North and thy silken guard shall take
    their place in the South, and summer shall leave the North and go to
    the South, and all the swallows shall rise and follow after. And alone
    in thine inner courts shall no change be, for they shall lie narrowly
    along that line that parteth the seasons in sunder and divideth the
    North from the South, and thy long gardens shall lie under them.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">And in thy gardens shall spring always be, for spring lies ever at
    the marge of summer; and autumn also shall always tint thy gardens,
    for autumn always flares at winter’s edge, and those gardens shall lie
    apart between winter and summer. And there shall be orchards in thy
    garden, too, with all the burden of autumn on their boughs and all the
    blossom of spring.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">Yea, I behold this palace, for we see future things; I see its white
    wall shine in the huge glare of midsummer, and the lizards lying along
    it motionless in the sun, and men asleep in the noonday, and the
    butterflies floating by, and birds of radiant plumage chasing
    marvellous moths; far off the forest and great orchids glorying there,
    and iridescent insects dancing round in the light. I see the wall upon
    the other side; the snow has come upon the battlements, the icicles
    have fringed them like frozen beards, a wild wind blowing out of
    lonely places and crying to the cold fields as it blows has sent the
    snowdrifts higher than the buttresses; they that look out through
    windows on that side of thy palace see the wild geese flying low and
    all the birds of the winter, going by swift in packs beat low by the
    bitter wind, and the clouds above them are black, for it is midwinter
    there; while in thine other courts the fountains tinkle, falling on
    marble warmed by the fire of the summer sun.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Such, O King of the Years, shall thy palace be, and its name shall be
    Erlathdronion, Earth’s Wonder; and thy wisdom shall bid thine
    architects build at once, that all may see what as yet the poets see
    only, and that prophecy be fulfilled.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And when the poet ceased the Sultan spake, and said, as all men
    hearkened with bent heads:
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>It will be unnecessary for my builders to build this palace,
    Erlathdronion, Earth’s Wonder, for in hearing thee we have drunk
    already its pleasures.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And the poet went forth from the Presence and dreamed a new thing.
