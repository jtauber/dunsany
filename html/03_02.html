  <h1>Thirteen at Table</h1>
  <p>
    In front of a spacious fireplace of the old kind, when the logs were
    well alight, and men with pipes and glasses were gathered before it in
    great easeful chairs, and the wild weather outside and the comfort
    that was within, and the season of the year—for it was Christmas—and
    the hour of the night, all called for the weird or uncanny, then out
    spoke the ex-master of foxhounds and told this tale.
  </p>
  <p>
    I once had an odd experience too. It was when I had the Bromley and
    Sydenham, the year I gave them up—as a matter of fact it was the last
    day of the season. It was no use going on because there were no foxes
    left in the county, and London was sweeping down on us. You could see
    it from the kennels all along the skyline like a terrible army in
    grey, and masses of villas every year came skirmishing down our
    valleys. Our coverts were mostly on the hills, and as the town came
    down upon the valleys the foxes used to leave them and go right away
    out of the county and they never returned. I think they went by night
    and moved great distances. Well it was early April and we had drawn
    blank all day, and at the last draw of all, the very last of the
    season, we found a fox. He left the covert with his back to London and
    its railways and villas and wire and slipped away towards the chalk
    country and open Kent. I felt as I once felt as a child on one
    summer’s day when I found a door in a garden where I played left
    luckily ajar, and I pushed it open and the wide lands were before me
    and waving fields of corn.
  </p>
  <p>
    We settled down into a steady gallop and the fields began to drift by
    under us, and a great wind arose full of fresh breath. We left the
    clay lands where the bracken grows and came to a valley at the edge of
    the chalk. As we went down into it we saw the fox go up the other side
    like a shadow that crosses the evening, and glide into a wood that
    stood on the top. We saw a flash of primroses in the wood and we were
    out the other side, hounds hunting perfectly and the fox still going
    absolutely straight. It began to dawn on me then that we were in for a
    great hunt, I took a deep breath when I thought of it; the taste of
    the air of that perfect Spring afternoon as it came to one galloping,
    and the thought of a great run, were together like some old rare wine.
    Our faces now were to another valley, large fields led down to it,
    with easy hedges, at the bottom of it a bright blue stream went
    singing and a rambling village smoked, the sunlight on the opposite
    slopes danced like a fairy; and all along the top old woods were
    frowning, but they dreamed of Spring. The <q>field</q> had fallen of and
    were far behind and my only human companion was James, my old first
    whip, who had a hound’s instinct, and a personal animosity against a
    fox that even embittered his speech.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across the valley the fox went as straight as a railway line, and
    again we went without a check straight through the woods at the top. I
    remember hearing men sing or shout as they walked home from work, and
    sometimes children whistled; the sounds came up from the village to
    the woods at the top of the valley. After that we saw no more
    villages, but valley after valley arose and fell before us as though
    we were voyaging some strange and stormy sea, and all the way before
    us the fox went dead up-wind like the fabulous Flying Dutchman. There
    was no one in sight now but my first whip and me, we had both of us
    got on to our second horses as we drew the last covert.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two or three times we checked in those great lonely valleys beyond the
    village, but I began to have inspirations, I felt a strange certainty
    within me that this fox was going on straight up-wind till he died or
    until night came and we could hunt no longer, so I reversed ordinary
    methods and only cast straight ahead and always we picked up the scent
    again at once. I believe that this fox was the last one left in the
    villa-haunted lands and that he was prepared to leave them for remote
    uplands far from men, that if we had come the following day he would
    not have been there, and that we just happened to hit off his journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evening began to descend upon the valleys, still the hounds drifted
    on, like the lazy but unresting shadows of clouds upon a summer’s day,
    we heard a shepherd calling to his dog, we saw two maidens move
    towards a hidden farm, one of them singing softly; no other sounds,
    but ours, disturbed the leisure and the loneliness of haunts that
    seemed not yet to have known the inventions of steam and gun-powder
    (even as China, they say, in some of her further mountains does not
    yet know that she has fought Japan).
  </p>
  <p>
    And now the day and our horses were wearing out, but that resolute fox
    held on. I began to work out the run and to wonder where we were. The
    last landmark I had ever seen before must have been over five miles
    back and from there to the start was at least ten miles more. If only
    we could kill! Then the sun set. I wondered what chance we had of
    killing our fox. I looked at James’ face as he rode beside me. He did
    not seem to have lost any confidence yet his horse was as tired as
    mine. It was a good clear twilight and the scent was as strong as
    ever, and the fences were easy enough, but those valleys were terribly
    trying and they still rolled on and on. It looked as if the light
    would outlast all possible endurance both of the fox and the horses,
    if the scent held good and he did not go to ground, otherwise night
    would end it. For long we had seen no houses and no roads, only chalk
    slopes with the twilight on them, and here and there some sheep, and
    scattered copses darkening in the evening. At some moment I seemed to
    realise all at once that the light was spent and that darkness was
    hovering, I looked at James, he was solemnly shaking his head.
    Suddenly in a little wooded valley we saw climb over the oaks the
    red-brown gables of a queer old house, at that instant I saw the fox
    scarcely heading by fifty yards. We blundered through a wood into full
    sight of the house, but no avenue led up to it or even a path nor were
    there any signs of wheel-marks anywhere. Already lights shone here and
    there in windows. We were in a park, and a fine park, but unkempt
    beyond credibility; brambles grew everywhere. It was too dark to see
    the fox any more but we knew he was dead beat, the hounds were just
    before us,—and a four-foot railing of oak. I shouldn’t have tried it
    on a fresh horse the beginning of a run, and here was a horse near his
    last gasp. But what a run! an event standing out in a lifetime, and
    the hounds close up on their fox, slipping into the darkness as I
    hesitated. I decided to try it. My horse rose about eight inches and
    took it fair with his breast, and the oak log flew into handfuls of
    wet decay—it rotten with years. And then we were on a lawn and at the
    far end of it the hounds were tumbling over their fox. Fox, hounds and
    light were all done together at the of a twenty-mile point. We made
    some noise then, but nobody came out of the queer old house.
  </p>
  <p>
    I felt pretty stiff as I walked round to the hall door with the mask
    and the brush while James went with the hounds and the two horses to
    look for the stables. I rang a bell marvellously encrusted with rust,
    and after a long while the door opened a little way revealing a hall
    with much old armour in it and the shabbiest butler that I have ever
    known.
  </p>
  <p>
    I asked him who lived there. Sir Richard Arlen. I explained that my
    horse could go no further that night and that I wished to ask Sir
    Richard Arlen for a bed for the night.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>O, no one ever comes here, sir,</q> said the butler.
  </p>
  <p>
    I pointed out that I had come.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>I don’t think it would be possible, sir,</q> he said.
  </p>
  <p>
    This annoyed me and I asked to see Sir Richard, and insisted until he
    came. Then I apologised and explained the situation. He looked only
    fifty, but a ’Varsity oar on the wall with the date of the early
    seventies, made him older than that; his face had something of the shy
    look of the hermit; he regretted that he had not room to put me up. I
    was sure that this was untrue, also I had to be put up there, there
    was nowhere else within miles, so I almost insisted. Then to my
    astonishment he turned to the butler and they talked it over in an
    undertone. At last they seemed to think that they could manage it,
    though clearly with reluctance. It was by now seven o’ clock and Sir
    Richard told me he dined at half past seven. There was no question of
    clothes for me other than those I stood in, as my host was shorter and
    broader. He showed me presently to the drawing-room and there he
    reappeared before half past seven in evening dress and a white
    waistcoat. The drawing-room was large and contained old furniture but
    it was rather worn than venerable, an Aubusson carpet flapped about
    the floor, the wind seemed momently to enter the room, and old
    draughts haunted corners; the stealthy feet of rats that were never at
    rest indicated the extent of the ruin that time had wrought in the
    wainscot; somewhere far off a shutter flapped to and fro, the
    guttering candles were insufficient to light so large a room. The
    gloom that these things suggested was quite in keeping with Sir
    Richard’s first remark to me after he entered the room: <q>I must tell
    you, sir, that I have led a wicked life. O, a very wicked life.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Such confidences from a man much older than oneself after one has
    known him for half an hour are so rare that any possible answer merely
    does not suggest itself. I said rather slowly, <q>O, really,</q> and
    chiefly to forestall another such remark I said <q>What a charming house
    you have.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Yes,</q> he said, <q>I have not left it for nearly forty years. Since I
    left the ’Varsity. One is young there, you know, and one has
    opportunities; but I make no excuses, no excuses.</q> And the door
    slipping its rusty latch, came drifting on the draught into the room,
    and the long carpet flapped and the hangings upon the walls, then the
    draught fell rustling away and the door slammed to again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Ah, Marianne,</q> he said, <q>we have a guest to-night. Mr. Linton. This
    is Marianne Gib.</q> And everything became clear to me. <q>Mad,</q> I said to
    myself, for no one had entered the room.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rats ran up the length of the room behind the wainscot
    ceaselessly, and the wind unlatched the door again and the folds of
    the carpet fluttered up to our feet and stopped there, for our weight
    held it down.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Let me introduce Mr. Linton,</q> said my host—<q>Lady Mary Errinjer.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    The door slammed back again. I bowed politely. Even had I been invited
    I should have humoured him, but it was the very least that an
    uninvited guest could do.
  </p>
  <p>
    This kind of thing happened eleven times, the rustling, and the
    fluttering of the carpet and the footsteps of the rats, and the
    restless door, and then the sad voice of my host introducing me to
    phantoms. Then for some while we waited while I struggled with the
    situation; conversation flowed slowly. And again the draught came
    trailing up the room, while the flaring candles filled it with
    hurrying shadows. <q>Ah, late again, Cicely,</q> said my host in his soft,
    mournful way. <q>Always late, Cicely.</q> Then I went down to dinner with
    that man and his mind and the twelve phantoms that haunted it. I found
    a long table with fine old silver on it and places laid for fourteen.
    The butler was now in evening dress, there were fewer draughts in the
    dining-room, the scene was less gloomy there. <q>Will you sit next to
    Rosalind at the other end,</q> Richard said to me. <q>She always takes the
    head of the table, I wronged her most of all.</q> I said, <q>I shall be
    delighted.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    I looked at the butler closely, but never did I see by any expression
    of his face or by anything that he did any suggestion that he waited
    upon less than fourteen people in the complete possession of all their
    faculties. Perhaps a dish appeared to be refused more often than taken
    but every glass was equally filled with champagne. At first I found
    little to say, but when Sir Richard speaking from the far end of the
    table said, <q>You are tired, Mr. Linton,</q> I was reminded that I owed
    something to a host upon whom I had forced myself. It was excellent
    champagne and with the help of a second glass I made the effort to
    begin a conversation with a Miss Helen Errold for whom the place upon
    one side of me was laid. It came more easy to me very soon, I
    frequently paused in my monologue, like Mark Anthony, for a reply, and
    sometimes I turned and spoke to Miss Rosalind Smith. Sir Richard at
    the other end talked sorrowfully on, he spoke as a condemned man might
    speak to his judge, and yet somewhat as a judge might speak to one
    that he once condemned wrongly. My own mind began to turn to mournful
    things. I drank another glass of champagne, but I was still thirsty. I
    felt as if all the moisture in my body had been blown away over the
    downs of Kent by the wind up which we had galloped. Still I was not
    talking enough; my host was looking at me. I made another effort,
    after all I had something to talk about, a twenty-mile point is not
    often seen in a lifetime, especially south of the Thames. I began to
    describe the run to Rosalind Smith. I could see then that my host was
    pleased, the sad look in his face gave a kind of a flicker, like mist
    upon the mountains on a miserable day when a faint puff comes from the
    sea and the mist would lift if it could. And the butler refilled my
    glass very attentively. I asked her first if she hunted, and paused
    and began my story. I told her where we had found the fox and how fast
    and straight he had gone, and how I had got through the village by
    keeping to the road, while the little gardens and wire, and then the
    river, had stopped the rest of the field. I told her the kind of
    country that we crossed and how splendid it looked in the Spring, and
    how mysterious the valleys were as soon as the twilight came, and what
    a glorious horse I had and how wonderfully he went. I was so fearfully
    thirsty after the great hunt that I had to stop for a moment now and
    then, but I went on with my description of that famous run, for I had
    warmed to the subject, and after all there was nobody to tell of it
    but me except my old whipper-in, and <q>the old fellow’s probably drunk
    by now,</q> I thought. I described to her minutely the exact spot in the
    run at which it had come to me clearly that this was going to be the
    greatest hunt in the whole history of Kent. Sometimes I forgot
    incidents that had happened as one well may in a run of twenty miles,
    and then I had to fill in the gaps by inventing. I was pleased to be
    able to make the party go off well by means of my conversation, and
    besides that the lady to whom I was speaking was extremely pretty: I
    do not mean in a flesh and blood kind of way but there were little
    shadowy lines about the chair beside me that hinted at an unusually
    graceful figure when Miss Rosalind Smith was alive; and I began to
    perceive that what I first mistook for the smoke of guttering candles
    and a table-cloth waving in the draught was in reality an extremely
    animated company who listened, and not without interest, to my story
    of by far the greatest hunt that the world had ever known: indeed I
    told them that I would confidently go further and predict that never
    in the history of the world would there be such a run again. Only my
    throat was terribly dry. And then as it seemed they wanted to hear
    more about my horse. I had forgotten that I had come there on a horse,
    but when they reminded me it all came back; they looked so charming
    leaning over the table intent upon what I said, that I told them
    everything they wanted to know. Everything was going so pleasantly if
    only Sir Richard would cheer up. I heard his mournful voice every now
    and then—these were very pleasant people if only he would take them
    the right way. I could understand that he regretted his past, but the
    early seventies seemed centuries away and I felt sure that he
    misunderstood these ladies, they were not revengeful as he seemed to
    suppose. I wanted to show him how cheerful they really were, and so I
    made a joke and they an laughed at it, and then I chaffed them a bit,
    especially Rosalind, and nobody resented it in the very least. And
    still Sir Richard sat there with that unhappy look, like one that has
    ended weeping because it is vain and has not the consolation even of
    tears.
  </p>
  <p>
    We had been a long time there and many of the candles had burned out,
    but there was light enough. I was glad to have an audience for my
    exploit, and being happy myself I was determined Sir Richard should
    be. I made more jokes and they still laughed good-naturedly; some of
    the jokes were a little broad perhaps but no harm was meant. And
    then—I do not wish to excuse myself—but I had had a harder day than
    I ever had had before and without knowing it I must have been
    completely exhausted; in this state the champagne had found me, and
    what would have been harmless at any other time must somehow have got
    the better of me when quite tired out—anyhow I went too far, I made
    some joke—I cannot in the least remember what—that suddenly seemed
    to offend them. I felt all at once a commotion in the air, I looked up
    and saw that they had all arisen from the table and were sweeping
    towards the door: I had not time to open it but it blew open on a
    wind, I could scarcely see what Sir Richard was doing because only two
    candles were left, I think the rest blew out when the ladies suddenly
    rose. I sprang up to apologise, to assure them—and then fatigue
    overcame me as it had overcome my horse at the last fence, I clutched
    at the table but the cloth came away and then I fell. The fall, and
    the darkness on the floor and the pent up fatigue of the day overcame
    me all three together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sun shone over glittering fields and in at a bedroom window and
    thousands of birds were chanting to the Spring, and there I was in an
    old four-poster bed in a quaint old panelled bedroom, fully dressed
    and wearing long muddy boots; someone had taken my spurs and that was
    all. For a moment I failed to realise and then it all came back, my
    enormity and the pressing need of an abject apology to Sir Richard. I
    pulled an embroidered bell rope until the butler came. He came in
    perfectly cheerful and indescribably shabby. I asked him if Sir
    Richard was up, and he said he had just gone down, and told me to my
    amazement that it was twelve o’clock. I asked to be shown in to Sir
    Richard at once. He was in his smoking-room. <q>Good morning,</q> he said
    cheerfully the moment I went in. I went directly to the matter in
    hand. <q>I fear that I insulted some ladies in your house—</q> I began.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>You did indeed,</q> he said, <q>You did indeed.</q> And then he burst into
    tears and took me by the hand. <q>How can I ever thank you?</q> he said to
    me then. <q>We have been thirteen at table for thirty years and I never
    dared to insult them because I had wronged them all, and now you have
    done it and I know they will never dine here again.</q> And for a long
    time he still held my hand, and then he gave it a grip and a kind of a
    shake which I took to mean <q>Goodbye</q> and I drew my hand away then and
    left the house. And I found James in the stables with the hounds and
    asked him how he had fared, and James, who is a man of very few words,
    said he could not rightly remember, and I got my spurs from the butler
    and climbed on to my horse and slowly we rode away from that queer old
    house, and slowly we wended home, for the hounds were footsore but
    happy and the horses were tired still. And when we recalled that the
    hunting season was ended we turned our faces to Spring and thought of
    the new things that try to replace the old. And that very year I
    heard, and have often heard since, of dances and happier dinners at
    Sir Richard Arlen’s house.
