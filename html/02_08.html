  <h1>THE QUEST OF THE QUEEN'S TEARS</h1>
  <p>
    Sylvia, Queen of the Woods, in her woodland palace, held court, and
    made a mockery of her suitors. She would sing to them, she said, she
    would give them banquets, she would tell them tales of legendary days,
    her jugglers should caper before them, her armies salute them, her
    fools crack jests with them and make whimsical quips, only she could
    not love them.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was not the way, they said, to treat princes in their splendour
    and mysterious troubadours concealing kingly names; it was not in
    accordance with fable; myth had no precedent for it. She should have
    thrown her glove, they said, into some lion’s den, she should have
    asked for a score of venomous heads of the serpents of Licantara, or
    demanded the death of any notable dragon, or sent them all upon some
    deadly quest, but that she could not love them—! It was unheard
    of—it had no parallel in the annals of romance.
  </p>
  <p>
    And then she said that if they must needs have a quest she would offer
    her hand to him who first should move her to tears: and the quest
    should be called, for reference in histories or song, the Quest of the
    Queen’s Tears, and he that achieved them she would wed, be he only a
    petty duke of lands unknown to romance.
  </p>
  <p>
    And many were moved to anger, for they hoped for some bloody quest;
    but the old lords chamberlain said, as they muttered among themselves
    in a far, dark end of the chamber, that the quest was hard and wise,
    for that if she could ever weep she might also love. They had known
    her all her childhood; she had never sighed. Many men had she seen,
    suitors and courtiers, and had never turned her head after one went
    by. Her beauty was as still sunsets of bitter evenings when all the
    world is frore, a wonder and a chill. She was as a sun-stricken
    mountain uplifted alone, all beautiful with ice, a desolate and lonely
    radiance late at evening far up beyond the comfortable world, not
    quite to be companioned by the stars, the doom of the mountaineer.
  </p>
  <p>
    If she could weep, they said, she could love, they said.
  </p>
  <p>
    And she smiled pleasantly on those ardent princes, and troubadours
    concealing kingly names.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then one by one they told, each suitor prince the story of his love,
    with outstretched hands and kneeling on the knee; and very sorry and
    pitiful were the tales, so that often up in the galleries some maid of
    the palace wept. And very graciously she nodded her head like a
    listless magnolia in the deeps of the night moving idly to all the
    breezes its glorious bloom.
  </p>
  <p>
    And when the princes had told their desperate loves and had departed
    away with no other spoil than of their own tears only, even then there
    came the unknown troubadours and told their tales in song, concealing
    their gracious names.
  </p>
  <p>
    And there was one, Ackronnion, clothed with rags, on which was the
    dust of roads, and underneath the rags was war-scarred armour whereon
    were the dints of blows; and when he stroked his harp and sang his song,
    in the gallery above maidens wept, and even old lords chamberlain
    whimpered among themselves and thereafter laughed through their tears
    and said: <q>It is easy to make old people weep and to bring idle tears
    from lazy girls; but he will not set a-weeping the Queen of the
    Woods.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And graciously she nodded, and he was the last. And disconsolate went
    away those dukes and princes, and troubadours in disguise. Yet
    Ackronnion pondered as he went away.
  </p>
  <p>
    King he was of Afarmah, Lool and Haf, over-lord of Zeroora and hilly
    Chang, and duke of the dukedoms of Molong and Mlash, none of them
    unfamiliar with romance or unknown or overlooked in the making of
    myth. He pondered as he went in his thin disguise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now by those that do not remember their childhood, having other things
    to do, be it understood that underneath fairyland, which is, as all
    men know, at the edge of the world, there dwelleth the Gladsome Beast.
    A synonym he for joy.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is known how the lark in its zenith, children at play out-of-doors,
    good witches and jolly old parents have all been compared—how
    aptly!—with this very same Gladsome Beast. Only one <q>crab</q> he has (if
    I may use slang for a moment to make myself perfectly clear), only one
    drawback, and that is that in the gladness of his heart he spoils the
    cabbages of the Old Man Who Looks After Fairyland,—and of course he
    eats men.
  </p>
  <p>
    It must further be understood that whoever may obtain the tears of the
    Gladsome Beast in a bowl, and become drunken upon them, may move all
    persons to shed tears of joy so long as he remains inspired by the
    potion to sing or to make music.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now Ackronnion pondered in this wise: that if he could obtain the
    tears of the Gladsome Beast by means of his art, withholding him from
    violence by the spell of music, and if a friend should slay the
    Gladsome Beast before his weeping ceased—for an end must come to
    weeping even with men—that so he might get safe away with the tears,
    and drink them before the Queen of the Woods and move her to tears of
    joy. He sought out therefore a humble knightly man who cared not for
    the beauty of Sylvia, Queen of the Woods, but had found a woodland
    maiden of his own once long ago in summer. And the man’s name was
    Arrath, a subject of Ackronnion, a knight-at-arms of the spear-guard:
    and together they set out through the fields of fable until they came
    to Fairyland, a kingdom sunning itself (as all men know) for leagues
    along the edges of the world. And by a strange old pathway they came
    to the land they sought, through a wind blowing up the pathway sheer
    from space with a kind of metallic taste from the roving stars. Even
    so they came to the windy house of thatch where dwells the Old Man Who
    Looks After Fairyland sitting by parlour windows that look away from
    the world. He made them welcome in his star-ward parlour, telling them
    tales of Space, and when they named to him their perilous quest he
    said it would be a charity to kill the Gladsome Beast; for he was
    clearly one of those that liked not its happy ways. And then he took
    them out through his back door, for the front door had no pathway nor
    even a step—from it the old man used to empty his slops sheer on to
    the Southern Cross—and so they came to the garden wherein his
    cabbages were, and those flowers that only blow in Fairyland, turning
    their faces always towards the comet, and he pointed them out the way
    to the place he called Underneath, where the Gladsome Beast had his
    lair. Then they manoeuvred. Ackronnion was to go by the way of the
    steps with his harp and an agate bowl, while Arrath went round by a
    crag on the other side. Then the Old Man Who Looks After Fairyland
    went back to his windy house, muttering angrily as he passed his
    cabbages, for he did not love the ways of the Gladsome Beast; and the
    two friends parted on their separate ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nothing perceived them but that ominous crow glutted overlong already
    upon the flesh of man.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wind blew bleak from the stars.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first there was dangerous climbing, and then Ackronnion gained the
    smooth, broad steps that led from the edge to the lair, and at that
    moment heard at the top of the steps the continuous chuckles of the
    Gladsome Beast.
  </p>
  <p>
    He feared then that its mirth might be insuperable, not to be saddened
    by the most grievous song; nevertheless he did not turn back then, but
    softly climbed the stairs and, placing the agate bowl upon a step,
    struck up the chaunt called Dolorous. It told of desolate, regretted
    things befallen happy cities long since in the prime of the world. It
    told of how the gods and beasts and men had long ago loved beautiful
    companions, and long ago in vain. It told of the golden host of happy
    hopes, but not of their achieving. It told how Love scorned Death, but
    told of Death’s laughter. The contented chuckles of the Gladsome Beast
    suddenly ceased in his lair. He rose and shook himself. He was still
    unhappy. Ackronnion still sang on the chaunt called Dolorous. The
    Gladsome Beast came mournfully up to him. Ackronnion ceased not for
    the sake of his panic, but still sang on. He sang of the malignity of
    time. Two tears welled large in the eyes of the Gladsome Beast.
    Ackronnion moved the agate bowl to a suitable spot with his foot. He
    sang of autumn and of passing away. Then the beast wept as the frore
    hills weep in the thaw, and the tears splashed big into the agate
    bowl. Ackronnion desperately chaunted on; he told of the glad
    unnoticed things men see and do not see again, of sunlight beheld
    unheeded on faces now withered away. The bowl was full. Ackronnion was
    desperate: the Beast was so close. Once he thought that its mouth was
    watering!—but it was only the tears that had run on the lips of the
    Beast. He felt as a morsel! The Beast was ceasing to weep! He sang of
    worlds that had disappointed the gods. And all of a sudden, crash! and
    the staunch spear of Arrath went home behind the shoulder, and the
    tears and the joyful ways of the Gladsome Beast were ended and over
    for ever.
  </p>
  <p>
    And carefully they carried the bowl of tears away, leaving the body of
    the Gladsome Beast as a change of diet for the ominous crow; and going
    by the windy house of thatch they said farewell to the Old Man Who
    Looks After Fairyland, who when he heard of the deed rubbed his hands
    together and mumbled again and again, <q>And a very good thing, too. My
    cabbages! My cabbages!</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And not long after Ackronnion sang again in the sylvan palace of the
    Queen of the Woods, having first drunk all the tears in his agate
    bowl. And it was a gala night, and all the court were there and
    ambassadors from the lands of legend and myth, and even some from
    Terra Cognita.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Ackronnion sang as he never sang before, and will not sing again.
    O, but dolorous, dolorous, are all the ways of man, few and fierce are
    his days, and the end trouble, and vain, vain his endeavour: and
    woman—who shall tell of it?—her doom is written with man’s by
    listless, careless gods with their faces to other spheres.
  </p>
  <p>
    Somewhat thus he began, and then inspiration seized him, and all the
    trouble in the beauty of his song may not be set down by me: there was
    much of gladness in it, and all mingled with grief: it was like the
    way of man: it was like our destiny.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sobs arose at his song, sighs came back along echoes: seneschals,
    soldiers, sobbed, and a clear cry made the maidens; like rain the
    tears came down from gallery to gallery.
  </p>
  <p>
    All round the Queen of the Woods was a storm of sobbing and sorrow.
  </p>
  <p>
    But no, she would not weep.
