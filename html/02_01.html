  <h1>THE BRIDE OF THE MAN-HORSE</h1>
  <p>
    In the morning of his two hundred and fiftieth year Shepperalk the
    centaur went to the golden coffer, wherein the treasure of the
    centaurs was, and taking from it the hoarded amulet that his father,
    Jyshak, in the years of his prime, had hammered from mountain gold and
    set with opals bartered from the gnomes, he put it upon his wrist, and
    said no word, but walked from his mother’s cavern. And he took with
    him too that clarion of the centaurs, that famous silver horn, that in
    its time had summoned to surrender seventeen cities of Man, and for
    twenty years had brayed at star-girt walls in the Siege of
    Tholdenblarna, the citadel of the gods, what time the centaurs waged
    their fabulous war and were not broken by any force of arms, but
    retreated slowly in a cloud of dust before the final miracle of the
    gods that They brought in Their desperate need from Their ultimate
    armoury. He took it and strode away, and his mother only sighed and
    let him go.
  </p>
  <p>
    She knew that today he would not drink at the stream coming down from
    the terraces of Varpa Niger, the inner land of the mountains, that
    today he would not wonder awhile at the sunset and afterwards trot
    back to the cavern again to sleep on rushes pulled by rivers that know
    not Man. She knew that it was with him as it had been of old with his
    father, and with Goom the father of Jyshak, and long ago with the
    gods. Therefore she only sighed and let him go.
  </p>
  <p>
    But he, coming out from the cavern that was his home, went for the
    first time over the little stream, and going round the corner of the
    crags saw glittering beneath him the mundane plain. And the wind of
    the autumn that was gilding the world, rushing up the slopes of the
    mountain, beat cold on his naked flanks. He raised his head and
    snorted.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>I am a man-horse now!</q> he shouted aloud; and leaping from crag to
    crag he galloped by valley and chasm, by torrent-bed and scar of
    avalanche, until he came to the wandering leagues of the plain, and
    left behind him for ever the Athraminaurian mountains.
  </p>
  <p>
    His goal was Zretazoola, the city of Sombelenë. What legend of
    Sombelenë’s inhuman beauty or of the wonder of her mystery had ever
    floated over the mundane plain to the fabulous cradle of the centaurs’
    race, the Athraminaurian mountains, I do not know. Yet in the blood of
    man there is a tide, an old sea-current rather, that is somehow akin
    to the twilight, which brings him rumours of beauty from however far
    away, as driftwood is found at sea from islands not yet discovered:
    and this spring-tide of current that visits the blood of man comes from
    the fabulous quarter of his lineage, from the legendary, the old; it
    takes him out to the woodlands, out to the hills; he listens to
    ancient song. So it may be that Shepperalk’s fabulous blood stirred in
    those lonely mountains away at the edge of the world to rumours that
    only the airy twilight knew and only confided secretly to the bat, for
    Shepperalk was more legendary even than man. Certain it was that he
    headed from the first for the city of Zretazoola, where Sombelenë in her
    temple dwelt; though all the mundane plain, its rivers and mountains,
    lay between Shepperalk’s home and the city he sought.
  </p>
  <p>
    When first the feet of the centaur touched the grass of that soft
    alluvial earth he blew for joy upon the silver horn, he pranced and
    caracoled, he gambolled over the leagues; pace came to him like a
    maiden with a lamp, a new and beautiful wonder; the wind laughed as it
    passed him. He put his head down low to the scent of the flowers, he
    lifted it up to be nearer the unseen stars, he revelled through
    kingdoms, took rivers in his stride; how shall I tell you, ye that
    dwell in cities, how shall I tell you what he felt as he galloped? He
    felt for strength like the towers of Bel-Narana; for lightness like
    those gossamer palaces that the fairy-spider builds ’twixt heaven and
    sea along the coasts of Zith; for swiftness like some bird racing up
    from the morning to sing in some city’s spires before daylight comes.
    He was the sworn companion of the wind. For joy he was as a song; the
    lightnings of his legendary sires, the earlier gods, began to mix with
    his blood; his hooves thundered. He came to the cities of men, and all
    men trembled, for they remembered the ancient mythical wars, and now
    they dreaded new battles and feared for the race of man. Not by Clio
    are these wars recorded; history does not know them, but what of that?
    Not all of us have sat at historians’ feet, but all have learned fable
    and myth at their mothers’ knees. And there were none that did not
    fear strange wars when they saw Shepperalk swerve and leap along the
    public ways. So he passed from city to city.
  </p>
  <p>
    By night he lay down unpanting in the reeds of some marsh or a forest;
    before dawn he rose triumphant, and hugely drank of some river in the
    dark, and splashing out of it would trot to some high place to find
    the sunrise, and to send echoing eastwards the exultant greetings of
    his jubilant horn. And lo! the sunrise coming up from the echoes, and
    the plains new-lit by the day, and the leagues spinning by like water
    flung from a top, and that gay companion, the loudly laughing wind,
    and men and the fears of men and their little cities; and, after that,
    great rivers and waste spaces and huge new hills, and then new lands
    beyond them, and more cities of men, and always the old companion, the
    glorious wind. Kingdom by kingdom slipt by, and still his breath was
    even. <q>It is a golden thing to gallop on good turf in one’s youth,</q>
    said the young man-horse, the centaur. <q>Ha, ha,</q> said the wind of the
    hills, and the winds of the plain answered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bells pealed in frantic towers, wise men consulted parchments,
    astrologers sought of the portent from the stars, the aged made subtle
    prophecies. <q>Is he not swift?</q> said the young. <q>How glad he is,</q> said
    children.
  </p>
  <p>
    Night after night brought him sleep, and day after day lit his gallop,
    till he came to the lands of the Athalonian men who live by the edges
    of the mundane plain, and from them he came to the lands of legend
    again such as those in which he was cradled on the other side of the
    world, and which fringe the marge of the world and mix with the
    twilight. And there a mighty thought came into his untired heart, for
    he knew that he neared Zretazoola now, the city of Sombelenë.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was late in the day when he neared it, and clouds coloured with
    evening rolled low on the plain before him; he galloped on into their
    golden mist, and when it hid from his eyes the sight of things, the
    dreams in his heart awoke and romantically he pondered all those
    rumours that used to come to him from Sombelenë, because of the
    fellowship of fabulous things. She dwelt (said evening secretly to the
    bat) in a little temple by a lone lakeshore. A grove of cypresses
    screened her from the city, from Zretazoola of the climbing ways. And
    opposite her temple stood her tomb, her sad lake-sepulchre with open
    door, lest her amazing beauty and the centuries of her youth should
    ever give rise to the heresy among men that lovely Sombelenë was
    immortal: for only her beauty and her lineage were divine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her father had been half centaur and half god; her mother was the
    child of a desert lion and that sphinx that watches the pyramids;—she
    was more mystical than Woman.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her beauty was as a dream, was as a song; the one dream of a lifetime
    dreamed on enchanted dews, the one song sung to some city by a
    deathless bird blown far from his native coasts by storm in Paradise.
    Dawn after dawn on mountains of romance or twilight after twilight
    could never equal her beauty; all the glow-worms had not the secret
    among them nor all the stars of night; poets had never sung it nor
    evening guessed its meaning; the morning envied it, it was hidden from
    lovers.
  </p>
  <p>
    She was unwed, unwooed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lions came not to woo her because they feared her strength, and
    the gods dared not love her because they knew she must die.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was what evening had whispered to the bat, this was the dream in
    the heart of Shepperalk as he cantered blind through the mist. And
    suddenly there at his hooves in the dark of the plain appeared the
    cleft in the legendary lands, and Zretazoola sheltering in the cleft,
    and sunning herself in the evening.
  </p>
  <p>
    Swiftly and craftily he bounded down by the upper end of the cleft,
    and entering Zretazoola by the outer gate which looks out sheer on the
    stars, he galloped suddenly down the narrow streets. Many that rushed
    out on to balconies as he went clattering by, many that put their
    heads from glittering windows, are told of in olden song. Shepperalk
    did not tarry to give greetings or to answer challenges from martial
    towers, he was down through the earthward gateway like the thunderbolt
    of his sires, and, like Leviathan who has leapt at an eagle, he surged
    into the water between temple and tomb.
  </p>
  <p>
    He galloped with half-shut eyes up the temple-steps, and, only seeing
    dimly through his lashes, seized Sombelenë by the hair, undazzled as
    yet by her beauty, and so haled her away; and, leaping with her over
    the floorless chasm where the waters of the lake fall unremembered
    away into a hole in the world, took her we know not where, to be her
    slave for all centuries that are allowed to his race.
  </p>
  <p>
    Three blasts he gave as he went upon that silver horn that is the
    world-old treasure of the centaurs. These were his wedding bells.
