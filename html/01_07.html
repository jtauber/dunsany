  <h1>THE SWORD AND THE IDOL</h1>
  <p>
    It was a cold winter’s evening late in the Stone Age; the sun had gone
    down blazing over the plains of Thold; there were no clouds, only the
    chill blue sky and the imminence of stars; and the surface of the sleeping
    Earth began to harden against the cold of the night. Presently from their
    lairs arose, and shook themselves and went stealthily forth, those of
    Earth’s children to whom it is the law to prowl abroad as soon as the dusk
    has fallen. And they went pattering softly over the plain, and their eyes
    shone in the dark, and crossed and recrossed one another in their courses.
    Suddenly there became manifest in the midst of the plain that fearful
    portent of the presence of Man—a little flickering fire. And the children
    of Earth who prowl abroad by night looked sideways at it and snarled and
    edged away; all but the wolves, who came a little nearer, for it was
    winter and the wolves were hungry, and they had come in thousands from the
    mountains, and they said in their hearts, <q>We are strong.</q> Around the fire
    a little tribe was encamped. They, too, had come from the mountains, and
    from lands beyond them, but it was in the mountains that the wolves first
    winded them; they picked up bones at first that the tribe had dropped, but
    they were closer now and on all sides. It was Loz who had lit the fire. He
    had killed a small furry beast, hurling his stone axe at it, and had
    gathered a quantity of reddish-brown stones, and had laid them in a long
    row, and placed bits of the small beast all along it; then he lit a fire
    on each side, and the stones heated, and the bits began to cook. It was at
    this time that the tribe noticed that the wolves who had followed them so
    far were no longer content with the scraps of deserted encampments. A line
    of yellow eyes surrounded them, and when it moved it was to come nearer.
    So the men of the tribe hastily tore up brushwood, and felled a small tree
    with their flint axes, and heaped it all over the fire that Loz had made,
    and for a while the great heap hid the flame, and the wolves came trotting
    in and sat down again on their haunches much closer than before; and the
    fierce and valiant dogs that belonged to the tribe believed that their end
    was about to come while fighting, as they had long since prophesied it
    would. Then the flame caught the lofty stack of brushwood, and rushed out
    of it, and ran up the side of it, and stood up haughtily far over the top,
    and the wolves seeing this terrible ally of Man reveling there in his
    strength, and knowing nothing of this frequent treachery to his masters,
    went slowly away as though they had other purposes. And for the rest of
    that night the dogs of the encampment cried out to them and besought them
    to come back. But the tribe lay down all round the fire under thick furs
    and slept. And a great wind arose and blew into the roaring heart of the
    fire till it was red no longer, but all pallid with heat. With the dawn
    the tribe awoke.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loz might have known that after such a mighty conflagration nothing could
    remain of his small furry beast, but there was hunger in him and little
    reason as he searched among the ashes. What he found there amazed him
    beyond measure; there was no meat, there was not even his row of
    reddish-brown stones, but something longer than a man’s leg and narrower
    than his hand, was lying there like a great flattened snake. When Loz
    looked at its thin edges and saw that it ran to a point, he picked up
    stones to chip it and make it sharp. It was the instinct of Loz to sharpen
    things. When he found that it could not be chipped his wonderment
    increased. It was many hours before he discovered that he could sharpen
    the edges by rubbing them with a stone; but at last the point was sharp,
    and all one side of it except near the end, where Loz held it in his hand.
    And Loz lifted it and brandished it, and the Stone Age was over. That
    afternoon in the little encampment, just as the tribe moved on, the Stone
    Age passed away, which, for perhaps thirty or forty thousand years, had
    slowly lifted Man from among the beasts and left him with his supremacy
    beyond all hope of reconquest.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was not for many days that any other man tried to make for himself an
    iron sword by cooking the same kind of small furry beast that Loz had
    tried to cook. It was not for many years that any thought to lay the meat
    along stones as Loz had done; and when they did, being no longer on the
    plains of Thold, they used flints or chalk. It was not for many
    generations that another piece of iron ore was melted and the secret
    slowly guessed. Nevertheless one of Earth’s many veils was torn aside by
    Loz to give us ultimately the steel sword and the plough, machinery and
    factories; let us not blame Loz if we think that he did wrong, for he did
    all in ignorance. The tribe moved on until it came to water, and there it
    settled down under a hill, and they built their huts there. Very soon they
    had to fight with another tribe, a tribe that was stronger than they; but
    the sword of Loz was terrible and his tribe slew their foes. You might
    make one blow at Loz, but then would come one thrust from that iron sword,
    and there was no way of surviving it. No one could fight with Loz. And he
    became ruler of the tribe in the place of Iz, who hitherto had ruled it
    with his sharp axe, as his father had before him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now Loz begat Lo, and in his old age gave his sword to him, and Lo ruled
    the tribe with it. And Lo called the name of the sword Death, because it
    was so swift and terrible.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Iz begat Ird, who was of no account. And Ird hated Lo because he was
    of no account by reason of the iron sword of Lo.
  </p>
  <p>
    One night Ird stole down to the hut of Lo, carrying his sharp axe, and he
    went very softly, but Lo’s dog, Warner, heard him coming, and he growled
    softly by his master’s door. When Ird came to the hut he heard Lo talking
    gently to his sword. And Lo was saying, <q>Lie still, Death. Rest, rest, old
    sword,</q> and then, <q>What, again, Death? Be still. Be still.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And then again: <q>What, art thou hungry, Death? Or thirsty, poor old sword?
    Soon, Death, soon. Be still only a little.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    But Ird fled, for he did not like the gentle tone of Lo as he spoke to his
    sword.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Lo begat Lod. And when Lo died Lod took the iron sword and ruled the
    tribe.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Ird begat Ith, who was of no account, like his father.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now when Lod had smitten a man or killed a terrible beast, Ith would go
    away for a while into the forest rather than hear the praises that would
    be given to Lod.
  </p>
  <p>
    And once, as Ith sat in the forest waiting for the day to pass, he
    suddenly thought he saw a tree trunk looking at him as with a face. And
    Ith was afraid, for trees should not look at men. But soon Ith saw that it
    was only a tree and not a man, though it was like a man. Ith used to speak
    to this tree, and tell it about Lod, for he dared not speak to any one
    else about him. And Ith found comfort in speaking about Lod.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day Ith went with his stone axe into the forest, and stayed there many
    days.
  </p>
  <p>
    He came back by night, and the next morning when the tribe awoke they saw
    something that was like a man and yet was not a man. And it sat on the
    hill with its elbows pointing outwards and was quite still. And Ith was
    crouching before it, and hurriedly placing before it fruits and flesh, and
    then leaping away from it and looking frightened. Presently all the tribe
    came out to see, but dared not come quite close because of the fear that
    they saw on the face of Ith. And Ith went to his hut, and came back again
    with a hunting spear-head and valuable small stone knives, and reached out
    and laid them before the thing that was like a man, and then sprang away
    from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    And some of the tribe questioned Ith about the still thing that was like a
    man, and Ith said, <q>This is Ged.</q> Then they asked, <q>Who is Ged?</q> and Ith
    said, <q>Ged sends the crops and the rain; and the sun and the moon are
    Ged’s.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the tribe went back to their huts, but later in the day some came
    again, and they said to Ith, <q>Ged is only as we are, having hands and
    feet.</q> And Ith pointed to the right hand of Ged, which was not as his
    left, but was shaped like the paw of a beast, and Ith said, <q>By this ye
    may know that he is not as any man.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then they said, <q>He is indeed Ged.</q> But Lod said, <q>He speaketh not, nor
    doth he eat,</q> and Ith answered, <q>The thunder is his voice and the famine
    is his eating.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    After this the tribe copied Ith, and brought little gifts of meat to Ged;
    and Ith cooked them before him that Ged might smell the cooking.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day a great thunderstorm came trampling up from the distance and raged
    among the hills, and the tribe all hid away from it in their huts. And Ith
    appeared among the huts looking unafraid. And Ith said little, but the
    tribe thought that he had expected the terrible storm because the meat
    that they had laid before Ged had been tough meat, and not the best parts
    of the beasts they slew.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Ged grew to have more honour among the tribe than Lod. And Lod was
    vexed.
  </p>
  <p>
    One night Lod arose when all were asleep, and quieted his dog, and took
    his iron sword and went away to the hill. And he came on Ged in the
    starlight, sitting still, with his elbows pointing outwards, and his
    beast’s paw, and the mark of the fire on the ground where his food had
    been cooked.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Lod stood there for a while in great fear, trying to keep to his
    purpose. Suddenly he stepped up close to Ged and lifted his iron sword,
    and Ged neither hit nor shrank. Then the thought came into Lod’s mind,
    <q>Ged does not hit. What will Ged do instead?</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And Lod lowered his sword and struck not, and his imagination began to
    work on that <q>What will Ged do instead?</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And the more Lod thought, the worse was his fear of Ged.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Lod ran away and left him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lod still ruled the tribe in battle or in the hunt, but the chiefest
    spoils of battle were given to Ged, and the beasts that they slew were
    Ged’s; and all questions that concerned war or peace, and questions of law
    and disputes, were always brought to him, and Ith gave the answers after
    speaking to Ged by night.
  </p>
  <p>
    At last Ith said, the day after an eclipse, that the gifts which they
    brought to Ged were not enough, that some far greater sacrifice was
    needed, that Ged was very angry even now, and not to be appeased by any
    ordinary sacrifice.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Ith said that to save the tribe from the anger of Ged he would speak
    to Ged that night, and ask him what new sacrifice he needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deep in his heart Lod shuddered, for his instinct told him that Ged wanted
    Lod’s only son, who should hold the iron sword when Lod was gone.
  </p>
  <p>
    No one would dare touch Lod because of the iron sword, but his instinct
    said in his slow mind again and again, <q>Ged loves Ith. Ith has said so.
    Ith hates the sword-holders.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Ith hates the sword-holders. Ged loves Ith.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Evening fell and the night came when Ith should speak with Ged, and Lod
    became ever surer of the doom of his race.
  </p>
  <p>
    He lay down but could not sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    Midnight had barely come when Lod arose and went with his iron sword again
    to the hill.
  </p>
  <p>
    And there sat Ged. Had Ith been to him yet? Ith whom Ged loved, who hated
    the sword-holders.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Lod looked long at the old sword of iron that had come to his
    grandfather on the plains of Thold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good-bye, old sword! And Lod laid it on the knees of Ged, then went away.
  </p>
  <p>
    And when Ith came, a little before dawn, the sacrifice was found
    acceptable unto Ged.
