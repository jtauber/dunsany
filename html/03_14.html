  <h1>A Narrow Escape</h1>
  <p>
    It was underground.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that dank cavern down below Belgrave Square the walls were
    dripping. But what was that to the magician? It was secrecy that he
    needed, not dryness. There he pondered upon the trend of events,
    shaped destinies and concocted magical brews.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the last few years the serenity of his ponderings had been
    disturbed by the noise of the motor-bus; while to his keen ears there
    came the earthquake-rumble, far off, of the train in the tube, going
    down Sloane Street; and when he heard of the world above his head was
    not to its credit.
  </p>
  <p>
    He decided one evening over his evil pipe, down there in his dank
    chamber, that London had lived long enough, had abused its
    opportunities, had gone too far, in fine, with its civilisation. And
    so he decided to wreck it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore he beckoned up his acolyte from the weedy end of the cavern,
    and, <q>Bring me,</q> he said, <q>the heart of the toad that dwelleth in
    Arabia and by the mountains of Bethany.</q> The acolyte slipped away by
    the hidden door, leaving that grim old man with his frightful pipe,
    and whither he went who knows but the gipsy people, or by what path he
    returned; but within a year he stood in the cavern again, slipping
    secretly in by the trap while the old man smoked, and he brought with
    him a little fleshy thing that rotted in a casket of pure gold.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>What is it?</q> the old man croaked.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>It is,</q> said the acolyte, <q>the heart of the toad that dwelt once
    in Arabia and by the mountains of Bethany.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    The old man’s crooked fingers closed on it, and he blessed the acolyte
    with his rasping voice and claw-like hand uplifted; the motor-bus
    rumbled above on its endless journey; far off the train shook Sloane
    Street.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Come,</q> said the old magician, <q>it is time.</q> And there and then they
    left the weedy cavern, the acolyte carrying cauldron, gold poker and
    all things needful, and went abroad in the light. And very wonderful
    the old man looked in his silks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their goal was the outskirts of London; the old man strode in front
    and the acolyte ran behind him, and there was something magical in the
    old man’s stride alone, without his wonderful dress, the cauldron and
    wand, the hurrying acolyte and the small gold poker.
  </p>
  <p>
    Little boys jeered till they caught the old man’s eye. So there went
    on through London this strange procession of two, too swift for any to
    follow. Things seemed worse up there than they did in the cavern, and
    the further they got on their way towards London’s outskirts the worse
    London got. <q>It is time,</q> said the old man, <q>surely.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And so they came at last to London’s edge and a small hill watching it
    with a mournful look. It was so mean that the acolyte longed for the
    cavern, dank though it was and full of terrible sayings that the old
    man said when he slept.
  </p>
  <p>
    They climbed the hill and put the cauldron down, and put there in the
    necessary things, and lit a fire of herbs that no chemist will sell
    nor decent gardener grow, and stirred the cauldron with the golden
    poker. The magician retired a little apart and muttered, then he
    strode back to the cauldron and, all being ready, suddenly opened the
    casket and let the fleshy thing fall in to boil.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then he made spells, then he flung up his arms; the fumes from the
    cauldron entering in at his mind he said raging things that he had not
    known before and runes that were dreadful (the acolyte screamed);
    there he cursed London from fog to loam-pit, from zenith to the abyss,
    motor-bus, factory, shop, parliament, people. <q>Let them all perish,</q>
    he said, <q>and London pass away, tram lines and bricks and pavement,
    the usurpers too long of the fields, let them all pass away and the
    wild hares come back, blackberry and briar-rose.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Let it pass,</q> he said, <q>pass now, pass utterly.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the momentary silence the old man coughed, then waited with eager
    eyes; and the long long hum of London hummed as it always has since
    first the reed-huts were set up by the river, changing its note at
    times but always humming, louder now than it was in years gone by, but
    humming night and day though its voice be cracked with age; so it
    hummed on.
  </p>
  <p>
    And the old man turned him round to his trembling acolyte and terribly
    said as he sank into the earth: <q>YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT ME THE HEART
    OF THE TOAD THAT DWELLETH IN ARABIA NOR BY THE MOUNTAINS OF BETHANY!</q>
