  <h1>BLAGDAROSS</h1>
  <p>
    On a waste place strewn with bricks in the outskirts of a town twilight
    was falling. A star or two appeared over the smoke, and distant windows
    lit mysterious lights. The stillness deepened and the loneliness. Then all
    the outcast things that are silent by day found voices.
  </p>
  <p>
    An old cork spoke first. He said: <q>I grew in Andalusian woods, but never
    listened to the idle songs of Spain. I only grew strong in the sunlight
    waiting for my destiny. One day the merchants came and took us all away
    and carried us all along the shore of the sea, piled high on the backs of
    donkeys, and in a town by the sea they made me into the shape that I am
    now. One day they sent me northward to Provence, and there I fulfilled my
    destiny. For they set me as a guard over the bubbling wine, and I
    faithfully stood sentinel for twenty years. For the first few years in the
    bottle that I guarded the wine slept, dreaming of Provence; but as the
    years went on he grew stronger and stronger, until at last whenever a man
    went by the wind would put out all his might against me, saying, <q>Let me
    go free; let me go free!</q> And every year his strength increased, and he
    grew more clamourous when men went by, but never availed to hurl me from
    my post. But when I had powerfully held him for twenty years they brought
    him to the banquet and took me from my post, and the wine arose rejoicing
    and leapt through the veins of men and exalted their souls within them
    till they stood up in their places and sang Provençal songs. But me they
    cast away—me that had been sentinel for twenty years, and was still as
    strong and staunch as when first I went on guard. Now I am an outcast in a
    cold northern city, who once have known the Andalusian skies and guarded
    long ago Provençal suns that swam in the heart of the rejoicing wine.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    An unstruck match that somebody had dropped spoke next. <q>I am a child of
    the sun,</q> he said, <q>and an enemy of cities; there is more in my heart than
    you know of. I am a brother of Etna and Stromboli; I have fires lurking in
    me that will one day rise up beautiful and strong. We will not go into
    servitude on any hearth nor work machines for our food, but we will take
    out own food where we find it on that day when we are strong. There are
    wonderful children in my heart whose faces shall be more lively than the
    rainbow; they shall make a compact with the North wind, and he shall lead
    them forth; all shall be black behind them and black above them, and there
    shall be nothing beautiful in the world but them; they shall seize upon
    the earth and it shall be theirs, and nothing shall stop them but our old
    enemy the sea.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then an old broken kettle spoke, and said: <q>I am the friend of cities. I
    sit among the slaves upon the hearth, the little flames that have been fed
    with coal. When the slaves dance behind the iron bars I sit in the middle
    of the dance and sing and make our masters glad. And I make songs about
    the comfort of the cat, and about the malice that is towards her in the
    heart of the dog, and about the crawling of the baby, and about the ease
    that is in the lord of the house when we brew the good brown tea; and
    sometimes when the house is very warm and slaves and masters are glad, I
    rebuke the hostile winds that prowl about the world.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And then there spoke the piece of an old cord. <q class="noclose">I was made in a place of
    doom, and doomed men made my fibres, working without hope. Therefore there
    came a grimness into my heart, so that I never let anything go free when
    once I was set to bind it. Many a thing have I bound relentlessly for
    months and years; for I used to come coiling into warehouses where the
    great boxes lay all open to the air, and one of them would be suddenly
    closed up, and my fearful strength would be set on him like accurse, and
    if his timbers groaned when first I seized them, or if they creaked aloud
    in the lonely night, thinking of woodlands out of which they came, then I
    only gripped them tighter still, for the poor useless hate is in my soul
    of those that made me in the place of doom. Yet, for all the things that
    my prison-clutch has held, the last work that I did was to set something
    free. I lay idle one night in the gloom on the warehouse floor. Nothing
    stirred there, and even the spider slept. Towards midnight a great flock
    of echoes suddenly leapt up from the wooden planks and circled round the
    roof. A man was coming towards me all alone. And as he came his soul was
    reproaching him, and I saw that there was a great trouble between the man
    and his soul, for his soul would not let him be, but went on reproaching
    him.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">Then the man saw me and said, <q>This at least will not fail me.</q> When I
    heard him say this about me, I determined that whatever he might require
    of me it should be done to the uttermost. And as I made this determination
    in my unfaltering heart, he picked me up and stood on an empty box that I
    should have bound on the morrow, and tied one end of me to a dark rafter;
    and the knot was carelessly tied, because his soul was reproaching him all
    the while continually and giving him no ease. Then he made the other end
    of me into a noose, but when the man’s soul saw this it stopped
    reproaching the man, and cried out to him hurriedly, and besought him to
    be at peace with it and to do nothing sudden; but the man went on with his
    work, and put the noose down over his face and underneath his chin, and
    the soul screamed horribly.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">Then the man kicked the box away with his foot, and the moment he did
    this I knew that my strength was not great enough to hold him; but I
    remembered that he had said I would not fail him, and I put all my grim
    vigour into my fibres and held by sheer will. Then the soul shouted to me
    to give way, but I said:</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose"><q>No; you vexed the man.</q></q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose">Then it screamed for me to leave go of the rafter, and already I was
    slipping, for I only held on to it by a careless knot, but I gripped with
    my prison grip and said:</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q class="noclose"><q>You vexed the man.</q></q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>And very swiftly it said other things to me, but I answered not; and at
    last the soul that vexed the man that had trusted me flew away and left
    him at peace. I was never able to bind things any more, for every one of
    my fibres was worn and wrenched, and even my relentless heart was weakened
    by the struggle. Very soon afterwards I was thrown out here. I have done
    my work.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    So they spoke among themselves, but all the while there loomed above them
    the form of an old rocking-horse complaining bitterly. He said: <q class="noclose">I am
    Blagdaross. Woe is me that I should lie now an outcast among these worthy
    but little people. Alas! for the days that are gathered, and alas for the
    Great One that was a master and a soul to me, whose spirit is now shrunken
    and can never know me again, and no more ride abroad on knightly quests. I
    was Bucephalus when he was Alexander, and carried him victorious as far as
    Ind. I encountered dragons with him when he was St. George, I was the
    horse of Roland fighting for Christendom, and was often Rosinante. I
    fought in tournays and went errant upon quests, and met Ulysses and the
    heroes and the fairies. Or late in the evening, just before the lamps in
    the nursery were put out, he would suddenly mount me, and we would gallop
    through Africa. There we would pass by night through tropic forests, and
    come upon dark rivers sweeping by, all gleaming with the eyes of
    crocodiles, where the hippopotamus floated down with the stream, and
    mysterious craft loomed suddenly out of the dark and furtively passed
    away. And when we had passed through the forest lit by the fireflies we
    would come to the open plains, and gallop onwards with scarlet flamingoes
    flying along beside us through the lands of dusky kings, with golden
    crowns upon their heads and scepters in their hands, who came running out
    of their palaces to see us pass. Then I would wheel suddenly, and the dust
    flew up from my four hooves as I turned and we galloped home again, and my
    master was put to bed. And again he would ride abroad on another day till
    we came to magical fortresses guarded by wizardry and overthrew the
    dragons at the gate, and ever came back with a princess fairer than the
    sea.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>But my master began to grow larger in his body and smaller in his soul,
    and then he rode more seldom upon quests. At last he saw gold and never
    came again, and I was cast out here among these little people.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    But while the rocking-horse was speaking two boys stole away, unnoticed by
    their parents, from a house on the edge of the waste place, and were
    coming across it looking for adventures. One of them carried a broom, and
    when he saw the rocking-horse he said nothing, but broke off the handle
    from the broom and thrust it between his braces and his shirt on the left
    side. Then he mounted the rocking-horse, and drawing forth the broomstick,
    which was sharp and spiky at the end, said, <q>Saladin is in this desert
    with all his paynims, and I am Coeur de Lion.</q> After a while the other boy
    said: <q>Now let me kill Saladin too.</q> But Blagdaross in his wooden heart,
    that exulted with thoughts of battle, said: <q>I am Blagdaross yet!</q>
