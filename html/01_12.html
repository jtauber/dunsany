  <h1>_In a letter from a friend whom I have never seen, one of those that read
my books, this line was quoted--"But he, he never came to Carcassonne." I
do not know the origin of the line, but I made this tale about it._</h1>
  <p>
    CARCASSONNE
  </p>
  <p>
    When Camorak reigned at Arn, and the world was fairer, he gave a festival
    to all the weald to commemorate the splendour of his youth.
  </p>
  <p>
    They say that his house at Arn was huge and high, and its ceiling painted
    blue; and when evening fell men would climb up by ladders and light the
    scores of candles hanging from slender chains. And they say, too, that
    sometimes a cloud would come, and pour in through the top of one of the
    oriel windows, and it would come over the edge of the stonework as the
    sea-mist comes over a sheer cliffs shaven lip where an old wind has blown
    for ever and ever (he has swept away thousands of leaves and thousands of
    centuries, they are all one to him, he owes no allegiance to Time). And
    the cloud would re-shape itself in the hall’s lofty vault and drift on
    through it slowly, and out to the sky again through another window. And
    from its shape the knights in Camorak’s hall would prophesy the battles
    and sieges of the next season of war. They say of the hall of Camorak at
    Arn that there hath been none like it in any land, and foretell that there
    will be never.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hither had come in the folk of the Weald from sheepfold and from forest,
    revolving slow thoughts of food, and shelter, and love, and they sat down
    wondering in that famous hall; and therein also were seated the men of
    Arn, the town that clustered round the King’s high house, and all was
    roofed with red, maternal earth.
  </p>
  <p>
    If old songs may be trusted, it was a marvelous hall.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many who sat there could only have seen it distantly before, a clear shape
    in the landscape, but smaller than a hill. Now they beheld along the wall
    the weapons of Camorak’s men, of which already the lute-players made
    songs, and tales were told at evening in the byres. There they described
    the shield of Camorak that had gone to and fro across so many battles, and
    the sharp but dinted edges of his sword; there were the weapons of Gadriol
    the Leal, and Norn, and Athoric of the Sleety Sword, Heriel the Wild,
    Yarold, and Thanga of Esk, their arms hung evenly all round the hall, low
    where a man could reach them; and in the place of honour in the midst,
    between the arms of Camorak and of Gadriol the Leal, hung the harp of
    Arleon. And of all the weapons hanging on those walls none were more
    calamitous to Camorak’s foes than was the harp of Arleon. For to a man
    that goes up against a strong place on foot, pleasant indeed is the twang
    and jolt of some fearful engine of war that his fellow-warriors are
    working behind him, from which huge rocks go sighing over his head and
    plunge among his foes; and pleasant to a warrior in the wavering light are
    the swift commands of his King, and a joy to him are his comrades’ instant
    cheers exulting suddenly at a turn of the war. All this and more was the
    harp to Camorak’s men; for not only would it cheer his warriors on, but
    many a time would Arleon of the Harp strike wild amazement into opposing
    hosts by some rapturous prophecy suddenly shouted out while his hand swept
    over the roaring strings. Moreover, no war was ever declared till Camorak
    and his men had listened long to the harp, and were elate with the music
    and mad against peace. Once Arleon, for the sake of a rhyme, had made war
    upon Estabonn; and an evil king was overthrown, and honour and glory won;
    from such queer motives does good sometimes accrue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above the shields and the harps all round the hall were the painted
    figures of heroes of fabulous famous songs. Too trivial, because too
    easily surpassed by Camorak’s men, seemed all the victories that the earth
    had known; neither was any trophy displayed of Camorak’s seventy battles,
    for these were as nothing to his warriors or him compared with those
    things that their youth had dreamed and which they mightily purposed yet
    to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above the painted pictures there was darkness, for evening was closing in,
    and the candles swinging on their slender chain were not yet lit in the
    roof; it was as though a piece of the night had been builded into the
    edifice like a huge natural rock that juts into a house. And there sat all
    the warriors of Arn and the Weald-folk wondering at them; and none were
    more than thirty, and all were skilled in war. And Camorak sat at the head
    of all, exulting in his youth.
  </p>
  <p>
    We must wrestle with Time for some seven decades, and he is a weak and
    puny antagonist in the first three bouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now there was present at this feast a diviner, one who knew the schemes of
    Fate, and he sat among the people of the Weald and had no place of honour,
    for Camorak and his men had no fear of Fate. And when the meat was eaten
    and the bones cast aside, the king rose up from his chair, and having
    drunken wine, and being in the glory of his youth and with all his knights
    about him, called to the diviner, saying, <q>Prophesy.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And the diviner rose up, stroking his grey beard, and spake
    guardedly—<q>There are certain events,</q> he said, <q>upon the ways of Fate
    that are veiled even from a diviner’s eyes, and many more are clear to us
    that were better veiled from all; much I know that is better unforetold,
    and some things that I may not foretell on pain of centuries of
    punishment. But this I know and foretell—that you will never come to
    Carcassonne.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Instantly there was a buzz of talk telling of Carcassonne—some had heard
    of it in speech or song, some had read of it, and some had dreamed of it.
    And the king sent Arleon of the Harp down from his right hand to mingle
    with the Weald-folk to hear aught that any told of Carcassonne. But the
    warriors told of the places they had won to—many a hard-held fortress,
    many a far-off land, and swore that they would come to Carcassonne.
  </p>
  <p>
    And in a while came Arleon back to the king’s right hand, and raised his
    harp and chanted and told of Carcassonne. Far away it was, and far and far
    away, a city of gleaming ramparts rising one over other, and marble
    terraces behind the ramparts, and fountains shimmering on the terraces. To
    Carcassonne the elf-kings with their fairies had first retreated from men,
    and had built it on an evening late in May by blowing their elfin horns.
    Carcassonne! Carcassonne!
  </p>
  <p>
    Travellers had seen it sometimes like a clear dream, with the sun
    glittering on its citadel upon a far-off hilltop, and then the clouds had
    come or a sudden mist; no one had seen it long or come quite close to it;
    though once there were some men that came very near, and the smoke from
    the houses blew into their faces, a sudden gust—no more, and these
    declared that some one was burning cedarwood there. Men had dreamed that
    there is a witch there, walking alone through the cold courts and
    corridors of marmorean palaces, fearfully beautiful and still for all her
    fourscore centuries, singing the second oldest song, which was taught her
    by the sea, shedding tears for loneliness from eyes that would madden
    armies, yet will she not call her dragons home—Carcassonne is terribly
    guarded. Sometimes she swims in a marble bath through whose deeps a river
    tumbles, or lies all morning on the edge of it to dry slowly in the sun,
    and watches the heaving river trouble the deeps of the bath. It flows
    through the caverns of earth for further than she knows, and coming to
    light in the witch’s bath goes down through the earth again to its own
    peculiar sea.
  </p>
  <p>
    In autumn sometimes it comes down black with snow that spring has molten
    in unimagined mountains, or withered blooms of mountain shrubs go
    beautifully by.
  </p>
  <p>
    When there is blood in the bath she knows there is war in the mountains;
    and yet she knows not where those mountains are.
  </p>
  <p>
    When she sings the fountains dance up from the dark earth, when she combs
    her hair they say there are storms at sea, when she is angry the wolves
    grow brave and all come down to the byres, when she is sad the sea is sad,
    and both are sad for ever. Carcassonne! Carcassonne!
  </p>
  <p>
    This city is the fairest of the wonders of Morning; the sun shouts when he
    beholdeth it; for Carcassonne Evening weepeth when Evening passeth away.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Arleon told how many goodly perils were round about the city, and how
    the way was unknown, and it was a knightly venture. Then all the warriors
    stood up and sang of the splendour of the venture. And Camorak swore by
    the gods that had builded Arn, and by the honour of his warriors that,
    alive or dead, he would come to Carcassonne.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the diviner rose and passed out of the hall, brushing the crumbs from
    him with his hands and smoothing his robe as he went.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Camorak said, <q>There are many things to be planned, and counsels to
    be taken, and provender to be gathered. Upon what day shall we start?</q> And
    all the warriors answering shouted, <q>Now.</q> And Camorak smiled thereat, for
    he had but tried them. Down then from the walls they took their weapons,
    Sikorix, Kelleron, Aslof, Wole of the Axe; Huhenoth, Peace-breaker;
    Wolwuf, Father of War; Tarion, Lurth of the Warcry and many another.
    Little then dreamed the spiders that sat in that ringing hall of the
    unmolested leisure they were soon to enjoy.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they were armed they all formed up and marched out of the hall, and
    Arleon strode before them singing of Carcassonne.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the talk of the Weald arose and went back well fed to byres. They had
    no need of wars or of rare perils. They were ever at war with hunger. A
    long drought or hard winter were to them pitched battles; if the wolves
    entered a sheep-fold it was like the loss of a fortress, a thunder-storm
    on the harvest was like an ambuscade. Well-fed, they went back slowly to
    their byres, being at truce with hunger; and the night filled with stars.
  </p>
  <p>
    And black against the starry sky appeared the round helms of the warriors
    as they passed the tops of the ridges, but in the valleys they sparkled
    now and then as the starlight flashed on steel.
  </p>
  <p>
    They followed behind Arleon going south, whence rumours had always come of
    Carcassonne: so they marched in the starlight, and he before them singing.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they had marched so far that they heard no sound from Arn, and even
    inaudible were her swinging bells, when candles burning late far up in
    towers no longer sent them their disconsolate welcome; in the midst of the
    pleasant night that lulls the rural spaces, weariness came upon Arleon and
    his inspiration failed. It failed slowly. Gradually he grew less sure of
    the way to Carcassonne. Awhile he stopped to think, and remembered the way
    again; but his clear certainty was gone, and in its place were efforts in
    his mind to recall old prophecies and shepherd’s songs that told of the
    marvelous city. Then as he said over carefully to himself a song that a
    wanderer had learnt from a goatherd’s boy far up the lower slope of
    ultimate southern mountains, fatigue came down upon his toiling mind like
    snow on the winding ways of a city noisy by night, stilling all.
  </p>
  <p>
    He stood, and the warriors closed up to him. For long they had passed by
    great oaks standing solitary here and there, like giants taking huge
    breaths of the night air before doing some furious deed; now they had come
    to the verge of a black forest; the tree-trunks stood like those great
    columns in an Egyptian hall whence God in an older mood received the
    praise of men; the top of it sloped the way of an ancient wind. Here they
    all halted and lighted a fire of branches, striking sparks from flint into
    a heap of bracken. They eased them of their armour, and sat round the
    fire, and Camorak stood up there and addressed them, and Camorak said: <q>We
    go to war with Fate, who has doomed that I shall not come to Carcassonne.
    And if we turn aside but one of the dooms of Fate, then the whole future
    of the world is ours, and the future that Fate has ordered is like the dry
    course of an averted river. But if such men as we, such resolute
    conquerors, cannot prevent one doom that Fate has planned, then is the
    race of man enslaved for ever to do its petty and allotted task.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then they all drew their swords, and waved them high in the firelight, and
    declared war on Fate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nothing in the somber forest stirred or made any sound.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tired men do not dream of war. When morning came over the gleaming fields
    a company that had set out from Arn discovered the discovered the
    camping-place of the warriors, and brought pavilions and provender. And
    the warriors feasted, and the birds in the forest sang, and the
    inspiration of Arleon awoke.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then they rose, and following Arleon, entered the forest, and marched away
    to the South. And many a woman of Arn sent her thoughts with them as they
    played alone some old monotonous tune, but their own thoughts were far
    before them, skimming over the bath through whose deeps the river tumbles
    in marble Carcassonne.
  </p>
  <p>
    When butterflies were dancing on the air, and the sun neared the zenith,
    pavilions were pitched, and all the warriors rested; and then they feasted
    again, and then played knightly games, and late in the afternoon marched
    on once more, singing of Carcassonne.
  </p>
  <p>
    And night came down with its mystery on the forest, and gave their
    demoniac look again to the trees, and rolled up out of misty hollows a
    huge and yellow moon.
  </p>
  <p>
    And the men of Arn lit fires, and sudden shadows arose and leaped
    fantastically away. And the night-wind blew, arising like a ghost, and
    passed between the tree trunks, and slipped down shimmering glades, and
    waked the prowling beasts still dreaming of day, and drifted nocturnal
    birds afield to menace timorous things, and beat the roses of the
    befriending night, and wafted to the ears of wandering men the sound of a
    maiden’s song, and gave a glamour to the lutanist’s tune played in his
    loneliness on distant hills; and the deep eyes of moths glowed like a
    galleon’s lamps, and they spread their wings and sailed their familiar
    sea. Upon this night-wind also the dreams of Camorak’s men floated to
    Carcassonne.
  </p>
  <p>
    All the next morning they marched, and all the evening, and knew they were
    nearing now the deeps of the forest. And the citizens of Arn kept close
    together and close behind the warriors. For the deeps of the forest were
    all unknown to travellers, but not unknown to those tales of fear that men
    tell at evening to their friends, in the comfort and the safety of their
    hearths. Then night appeared, and an enormous moon. And the men of Camorak
    slept. Sometimes they woke, and went to sleep again; and those that stayed
    awake for long and listened heard heavy two-footed creatures pad through
    the night on paws.
  </p>
  <p>
    As soon as it was light the unarmed men of Arn began to slip away, and
    went back by bands through the forest. When darkness came they did not
    stop to sleep, but continued their flight straight on until they came to
    Arn, and added there by the tales they told to the terror of the forest.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the warriors feasted, and afterwards Arleon rose, and played his harp,
    and led them on again; and a few faithful servants stayed with them still.
    And they marched all day through a gloom that was as old as night, but
    Arleon’s inspiration burned in his mind like a star. And he led them till
    the birds began to drop into the treetops, and it was evening and they all
    encamped. They had only one pavilion left to them now, and near it they
    lit a fire, and Camorak posted a sentry with drawn sword just beyond the
    glow of the firelight. Some of the warriors slept in the pavilion and
    others round about it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When dawn came something terrible had killed and eaten the sentry. But the
    splendour of the rumours of Carcassonne and Fate’s decree that they should
    never come there, and the inspiration of Arleon and his harp, all urged
    the warriors on; and they marched deeper and deeper all day into the
    forest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once they saw a dragon that had caught a bear and was playing with it,
    letting it run a little way and overtaking it with a paw.
  </p>
  <p>
    They came at last to a clear space in the forest just before nightfall. An
    odour of flowers arose from it like a mist, and every drop of dew
    interpreted heaven unto itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was the hour when twilight kisses Earth.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was the hour when a meaning comes into senseless things, and trees
    out-majesty the pomp of monarchs, and the timid creatures steal abroad to
    feed, and as yet the beasts of prey harmlessly dream, and Earth utters a
    sigh, and it is night.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the midst of the wide clearing Camorak’s warriors camped, and rejoiced
    to see stars again appearing one by one.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night they ate the last of their provisions, and slept unmolested by
    the prowling things that haunt the gloom of the forest.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the next day some of the warriors hunted stags, and others lay in
    rushes by a neighbouring lake and shot arrows at water-fowl. One stag was
    killed, and some geese, and several teal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here the adventurers stayed, breathing the pure wild air that cities know
    not; by day they hunted, and lit fires by night, and sang and feasted, and
    forgot Carcassonne. The terrible denizens of the gloom never molested
    them, venison was plentiful, and all manner of water-fowl: they loved the
    chase by day, and by night their favourite songs. Thus day after day went
    by, thus week after week. Time flung over this encampment a handful of
    moons, the gold and silver moons that waste the year away; Autumn and
    Winter passed, and Spring appeared; and still the warriors hunted and
    feasted there.
  </p>
  <p>
    One night of the springtide they were feasting about a fire and telling
    tales of the chase, and the soft moths came out of the dark and flaunted
    their colours in the firelight, and went out grey into the dark again; and
    the night wind was cool upon the warriors’ necks, and the camp-fire was
    warm in their faces, and a silence had settled among them after some song,
    and Arleon all at once rose suddenly up, remembering Carcassonne. And his
    hand swept over the strings of his harp, awaking the deeper chords, like
    the sound of a nimble people dancing their steps on bronze, and the music
    rolled away into the night’s own silence, and the voice of Arleon rose:
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>When there is blood in the bath she knows there is war in the mountains
    and longs for the battle-shout of kingly men.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And suddenly all shouted, <q>Carcassonne!</q> And at that word their idleness
    was gone as a dream is gone from a dreamer waked with a shout. And soon
    the great march began that faltered no more nor wavered. Unchecked by
    battles, undaunted in lonesome spaces, ever unwearied by the vulturous
    years, the warriors of Camorak held on; and Arleon’s inspiration led them
    still. They cleft with the music of Arleon’s harp the gloom of ancient
    silences; they went singing into battles with terrible wild men, and came
    out singing, but with fewer voices; they came to villages in valleys full
    of the music of bells, or saw the lights at dusk of cottages sheltering
    others.
  </p>
  <p>
    They became a proverb for wandering, and a legend arose of strange,
    disconsolate men. Folks spoke of them at nightfall when the fire was warm
    and rain slipped down the eaves; and when the wind was high small children
    feared the Men Who Would Not Rest were going clattering past. Strange
    tales were told of men in old grey armour moving at twilight along the
    tops of the hills and never asking shelter; and mothers told their boys
    who grew impatient of home that the grey wanderers were once so impatient
    and were now hopeless of rest, and were driven along with the rain
    whenever the wind was angry.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the wanderers were cheered in their wandering by the hope of coming to
    Carcassonne, and later on by anger against Fate, and at last they marched
    on still because it seemed better to march on than to think.
  </p>
  <p>
    For many years they had wandered and had fought with many tribes; often
    they gathered legends in villages and listened to idle singers singing
    songs; and all the rumours of Carcassonne still came from the South.
  </p>
  <p>
    And then one day they came to a hilly land with a legend in it that only
    three valleys away a man might see, on clear days, Carcassonne. Tired
    though they were and few, and worn with the years which had all brought
    them wars, they pushed on instantly, led still by Arleon’s inspiration
    which dwindled in his age, though he made music with his old harp still.
  </p>
  <p>
    All day they climbed down into the first valley and for two days ascended,
    and came to the Town That May Not Be Taken In War below the top of the
    mountain, and its gates were shut against them, and there was no way
    round. To left and right steep precipices stood for as far as eye could
    see or legend tell of, and the pass lay through the city. Therefore
    Camorak drew up his remaining warriors in line of battle to wage their
    last war, and they stepped forward over the crisp bones of old, unburied
    armies.
  </p>
  <p>
    No sentinel defied them in the gate, no arrow flew from any tower of war.
    One citizen climbed alone to the mountain’s top, and the rest hid
    themselves in sheltered places.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, in the top of the mountain was a deep, bowl-like cavern in the rock,
    in which fires bubbled softly. But if any cast a boulder into the fires,
    as it was the custom for one of those citizens to do when enemies
    approached them, the mountain hurled up intermittent rocks for three days,
    and the rocks fell flaming all over the town and all round about it. And
    just as Camorak’s men began to batter the gate they heard a crash on the
    mountain, and a great rock fell beyond them and rolled into the valley.
    The next two fell in front of them on the iron roofs of the town. Just as
    they entered the town a rock found them crowded in a narrow street, and
    shattered two of them. The mountain smoked and panted; with every pant a
    rock plunged into the streets or bounced along the heavy iron roof, and
    the smoke went slowly up, and up, and up.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they had come through the long town’s empty streets to the locked
    gate at the end, only fifteen were left. When they had broken down the
    gate there were only ten alive. Three more were killed as they went up the
    slope, and two as they passed near the terrible cavern. Fate let the rest
    go some way down the mountain upon the other side, and then took three of
    them. Camorak and Arleon alone were left alive. And night came down on the
    valley to which they had come, and was lit by flashes from the fatal
    mountain; and the two mourned for their comrades all night long.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when the morning came they remembered their war with Fate, and their
    old resolve to come to Carcassonne, and the voice of Arleon rose in a
    quavering song, and snatches of music from his old harp, and he stood up
    and marched with his face southwards as he had done for years, and behind
    him Camorak went. And when at last they climbed from the third valley, and
    stood on the hill’s summit in the golden sunlight of evening, their aged
    eyes saw only miles of forest and the birds going to roost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their beards were white, and they had travelled very far and hard; it was
    the time with them when a man rests from labours and dreams in light sleep
    of the years that were and not of the years to come.
  </p>
  <p>
    Long they looked southwards; and the sun set over remoter forests, and
    glow-worms lit their lamps, and the inspiration of Arleon rose and flew
    away for ever, to gladden, perhaps, the dreams of younger men.
  </p>
  <p>
    And Arleon said: <q>My King, I know no longer the way to Carcassonne.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And Camorak smiled, as the aged smile, with little cause for mirth, and
    said: <q>The years are going by us like huge birds, whom Doom and Destiny
    and the schemes of God have frightened up out of some old grey marsh. And
    it may well be that against these no warrior may avail, and that Fate has
    conquered us, and that our quest has failed.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    And after this they were silent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then they drew their swords, and side by side went down into the forest,
    still seeking Carcassonne.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think they got not far; for there were deadly marshes in that forest,
    and gloom that outlasted the nights, and fearful beasts accustomed to its
    ways. Neither is there any legend, either in verse or among the songs of
    the people of the fields, of any having come to Carcassonne.
