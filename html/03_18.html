  <h1>The Exiles Club</h1>
  <p>
    It was an evening party; and something someone had said to me had
    started me talking about a subject that to me is full of fascination,
    the subject of old religions, forsaken gods. The truth (for all
    religions have some of it), the wisdom, the beauty, of the religions
    of countries to which I travel have not the same appeal for me; for
    one only notices in them their tyranny and intolerance and the abject
    servitude that they claim from thought; but when a dynasty has been
    dethroned in heaven and goes forgotten and outcast even among men,
    one’s eyes no longer dazzled by its power find something very wistful
    in the faces of fallen gods suppliant to be remembered, something
    almost tearfully beautiful, like a long warm summer twilight fading
    gently away after some day memorable in the story of earthly wars.
    Between what Zeus, for instance, has been once and the half-remembered
    tale he is today there lies a space so great that there is no change
    of fortune known to man whereby we may measure the height down which
    he has fallen. And it is the same with many another god at whom once
    the ages trembled and the twentieth century treats as an old wives’
    tale. The fortitude that such a fall demands is surely more than
    human.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some such things as these I was saying, and being upon a subject that
    much attracts me I possibly spoke too loudly, certainly I was not
    aware that standing close behind me was no less a person than the
    ex-King of Eritivaria, the thirty islands of the East, or I would have
    moderated my voice and moved away a little to give him more room. I
    was not aware of his presence until his satellite, one who had fallen
    with him into exile but still revolved about him, told me that his
    master desired to know me; and so to my surprise I was presented
    though neither of them even knew my name. And that was how I came to
    be invited by the ex-King to dine at his club.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the time I could only account for his wishing to know me by
    supposing that he found in his own exiled condition some likeness to
    the fallen fortunes of the gods of whom I talked unwitting of his
    presence; but now I know that it was not of himself he was thinking
    when he asked me to dine at that club.
  </p>
  <p>
    The club would have been the most imposing building in any street in
    London, but in that obscure mean quarter of London in which they had
    built it it appeared unduly enormous. Lifting right up above those
    grotesque houses and built in that Greek style that we call Georgian,
    there was something Olympian about it. To my host an unfashionable
    street could have meant nothing, through all his youth wherever he had
    gone had become fashionable the moment he went there; words like the
    East End could have had no meaning to him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whoever built that house had enormous wealth and cared nothing for
    fashion, perhaps despised it. As I stood gazing at the magnificent
    upper windows draped with great curtains, indistinct in the evening,
    on which huge shadows flickered my host attracted my attention from
    the doorway, and so I went in and met for the second time the ex-King
    of Eritivaria.
  </p>
  <p>
    In front of us a stairway of rare marble led upwards, he took me
    through a side-door and downstairs and we came to a banqueting-hall of
    great magnificence. A long table ran up the middle of it, laid for
    quite twenty people, and I noticed the peculiarity that instead of
    chairs there were thrones for everyone except me, who was the only
    guest and for whom there was an ordinary chair. My host explained to
    me when we all sat down that everyone who belonged to that club was by
    rights a king.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact none was permitted, he told me, to belong to the club until
    his claim to a kingdom made out in writing had been examined and
    allowed by those whose duty it was. The whim of a populace or the
    candidate’s own misrule were never considered by the investigators,
    nothing counted with them but heredity and lawful descent from kings,
    all else was ignored. At that table there were those who had once
    reigned themselves, others lawfully claimed descent from kings that
    the world had forgotten, the kingdoms claimed by some had even changed
    their names. Hatzgurh, the mountain kingdom, is almost regarded as
    mythical.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have seldom seen greater splendour than that long hall provided
    below the level of the street. No doubt by day it was a little sombre,
    as all basements are, but at night with its great crystal chandeliers,
    and the glitter of heirlooms that had gone into exile, it surpassed
    the splendour of palaces that have only one king. They had come to
    London suddenly most of those kings, or their fathers before them, or
    forefathers; some had come away from their kingdoms by night, in a
    light sleigh, flogging the horses, or had galloped clear with morning
    over the border, some had trudged roads for days from their capital in
    disguise, yet many had had time just as they left to snatch up some
    small thing without price in markets, for the sake of old times as
    they said, but quite as much, I thought, with an eye to the future.
    And there these treasures glittered on that long table in the
    banqueting-hall of the basement of that strange club. Merely to see
    them was much, but to hear their story that their owners told was to
    go back in fancy to epic times on the romantic border of fable and
    fact, where the heroes of history fought with the gods of myth. The
    famous silver horses of Gilgianza were there climbing their sheer
    mountain, which they did by miraculous means before the time of the
    Goths. It was not a large piece of silver but its workmanship
    outrivalled the skill of the bees.
  </p>
  <p>
    A yellow Emperor had brought out of the East a piece of that
    incomparable porcelain that had made his dynasty famous though all
    their deeds are forgotten, it had the exact shade of the right purple.
  </p>
  <p>
    And there was a little golden statuette of a dragon stealing a diamond
    from a lady, the dragon had the diamond in his claws, large and of the
    first water. There had been a kingdom whose whole constitution and
    history were founded on the legend, from which alone its kings had
    claimed their right to the scepter, that a dragon stole a diamond from
    a lady. When its last king left that country, because his favorite
    general used a peculiar formation under the fire of artillery, he
    brought with him the little ancient image that no longer proved him a
    king outside that singular club.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was the pair of amethyst cups of the turbaned King of Foo, the
    one that he drank from himself, and the one that he gave to his
    enemies, eye could not tell which was which.
  </p>
  <p>
    All these things the ex-King of Eritivaria showed me, telling me a
    marvelous tale of each; of his own he had brought nothing, except the
    mascot that used once to sit on the top of the water tube of his
    favorite motor.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have not outlined a tenth of the splendour of that table, I had
    meant to come again and examine each piece of plate and make notes of
    its history; had I known that this was the last time I should wish to
    enter that club I should have looked at its treasures more
    attentively, but now as the wine went round and the exiles began to
    talk I took my eyes from the table and listened to strange tales of
    their former state.
  </p>
  <p>
    He that has seen better times has usually a poor tale to tell, some
    mean and trivial thing has been his undoing, but they that dined in
    that basement had mostly fallen like oaks on nights of abnormal
    tempest, had fallen mightily and shaken a nation. Those who had not
    been kings themselves, but claimed through an exiled ancestor, had
    stories to tell of even grander disaster, history seeming to have
    mellowed their dynasty’s fate as moss grows over an oak a great while
    fallen. There were no jealousies there as so often there are among
    kings, rivalry must have ceased with the loss of their navies and
    armies, and they showed no bitterness against those that had turned
    them out, one speaking of the error of his Prime Minister by which he
    had lost his throne as <q>poor old Friedrich’s Heaven-sent gift of
    tactlessness.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    They gossiped pleasantly of many things, the tittle-tattle we all had
    to know when we were learning history, and many a wonderful story I
    might have heard, many a side light on mysterious wars had I not made
    use of one unfortunate word. That word was <q>upstairs.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    The ex-King of Eritivaria having pointed out to me those unparalleled
    heirlooms to which I have alluded, and many more besides, hospitably
    asked me if there was anything else that I would care to see, he meant
    the pieces of plate that they had in the cupboards, the curiously
    graven swords of other princes, historic jewels, legendary seals, but
    I who had had a glimpse of their marvelous staircase, whose balustrade
    I believed to be solid gold and wondering why in such a stately house
    they chose to dine in the basement, mentioned the word <q>upstairs.</q> A
    profound hush came down on the whole assembly, the hush that might
    greet levity in a cathedral.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Upstairs!</q> he gasped. <q>We cannot go upstairs.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    I perceived that what I had said was an ill-chosen thing. I tried to
    excuse myself but knew not how.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Of course,</q> I muttered, <q>members may not take guests upstairs.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Members!</q> he said to me. <q>We are not the members!</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    There was such reproof in his voice that I said no more, I looked at
    him questioningly, perhaps my lips moved, I may have said <q>What are
    you?</q> A great surprise had come on me at their attitude.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>We are the waiters,</q> he said.
  </p>
  <p>
    That I could not have known, here at last was honest ignorance that I
    had no need to be ashamed of, the very opulence of their table denied
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Then who are the members?</q> I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such a hush fell at that question, such a hush of genuine awe, that
    all of a sudden a wild thought entered my head, a thought strange and
    fantastic and terrible. I gripped my host by the wrist and hushed my
    voice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <q>Are they too exiles?</q> I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Twice as he looked in my face he gravely nodded his head.
  </p>
  <p>
    I left that club very swiftly indeed, never to see it again, scarcely
    pausing to say farewell to those menial kings, and as I left the door
    a great window opened far up at the top of the house and a flash of
    lightning streamed from it and killed a dog.
